TO ALL THE VOLUMES OF THIS SERIES OF COMMENTARIES.
</p>
<hr class="medium">

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> object of this
Commentary is to aid in their Christian work those
who are endeavoring to promote the knowledge of the principles
which Jesus Christ came to propound and <span style="white-space:nowrap;">establish—clergymen,</span> Christian
parents, Sunday-School teachers, Bible-women, lay-preachers. Intended
for Christian workers, it aims to give the results rather than the processes
of scholarship, the conclusions rather than the controversies of scholars;
intended for laymen as well as for clergymen, it accompanies the English
version of the New Testament, in all references to the original Greek gives
the English equivalent, and translates all quotations from the French,
German, Latin and Greek authors.</p>

<p>The introduction to Volume <abbr title="One">I</abbr> contains a statement of those principles
of interpretation which appear to me to be essential to the correct
understanding of the Word of God. This Commentary is the result of a
conscientious endeavor to apply those principles to the elucidation of the
New Testament.</p>

<p>It is founded on a careful examination of the latest and best text; such
variations as are of practical or doctrinal importance are indicated in the
notes. It is founded on the original Greek; wherever that is inadequately
rendered in our English version, a new translation is afforded by the notes.
The general purpose of the writer or speaker, and the general scope of the
incident or teaching, is indicated in a Preliminary Note to the passage, or
in an analysis, a paraphrase, or a general summary at the close. Special
topics are treated in preliminary or supplementary notes. The results of recent
researches in Biblical archæology have been embodied, so as to make
the Commentary serve in part the purpose of a Bible Dictionary. A free
use is made of illustrations, from antiques, photographs, original drawings,
and other trustworthy sources. They are never employed for mere
ornament, but always to aid in depicting the life of Palestine, which
remains in many respects substantially unchanged by the lapse of time.
Since the Commentary is prepared, not for devotional reading, but for
practical workers, little space has been devoted to hortatory remarks or
practical or spiritual reflections. But I have uniformly sought to interpret
the letter by the spirit, and to suggest rather than to supply moral and
spiritual reflections, a paragraph of hints is affixed to each section or topic,
embodying what appears to me to be the essential religious lessons of the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
incident or the teaching; sometimes a note is appended elucidating
them more fully. The best thoughts of the best thinkers, both exegetical
and homiletical, are freely quoted, especially such as are not likely to be
accessible to most American readers; in all such cases the thought is
credited to the author. Parallel and contrasted passages of Scripture are
brought together in the notes; in addition, full Scripture references are
appended to the text. These are taken substantially from Bagster’s large
edition of the English version of the Polyglot Bible, but they have been
carefully examined and verified in preparing for the press, and some
modifications have been made. For the convenience of that large class of
Christian workers who are limited in their means, I have endeavored to
make this Commentary, as far as practicable, a complete apparatus for the
study of the New Testament. When finished it will be fully furnished
with <span style="white-space:nowrap;">maps;—there</span> are four in this volume; a Gazetteer gives a condensed
account of all the principal places in Palestine, mentioned in our Lord’s
life; and an introduction traces the history of the New Testament from
the days of Christ to the present, giving some account of the evidence and
nature of inspiration, the growth of the canon, the character and history
of the manuscripts, the English version, the nature of the Gospels and
their relation to each other, a brief life of Christ, and a complete tabular
harmony of the four Gospels.</p>

<p>The want of all who use the Bible in Christian work is the same. The
<em>wish</em> is often for a demonstration that the Scripture sustains the reader’s
peculiar theological tenets, but the <em>want</em> is always for a clearer and better
knowledge of Scripture teaching, whether it sanctions or overturns previous
opinions. I am not conscious that this work is written in the interest of
any theological or ecclesiastical system. In those cases in which the best
scholars are disagreed in their interpretation, the different views and the
reasons which lead me to my own conclusions have been given, I trust, in
no controversial spirit. For the sole object of this work is to ascertain
and make clear the meaning of the Word of God, irrespective of systems,
whether ecclesiastical or doctrinal.</p>

<p>No work is more delightful than that which throws us into fellowship
with great minds; of all work the most delightful is that which brings us
into association with the mind of God. This is the fellowship to which the
student of the Bible aspires. I can have for those who use this work no
higher hope than that they may find in its employment some of the happiness
which I have found in its preparation, and that it may serve them as
it has served me, as a guide to the Word of God, and through that Word
to a better acquaintance with God himself.</p>

<h3>
INTRODUCTION.<br>
</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the beginning of the third century to
near the close of the seventeenth, the Fourth
Gospel was by a common and substantially a
unanimous consent attributed to the Apostle
John. This authorship was then questioned, at
first by an English critic by the name of Evanson.
The discussion was soon transferred to Germany,
where it waxed warm, and whence it was again
transferred to England and this country.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It
may now be regarded as the most hotly contested
question in biblical criticism. The controversy
has been intensified by prejudices and
feeling on both sides. It is indeed impossible to
discuss it with cool indifference, as a mere matter
of curious literary interest. If this Gospel
was written by the Apostle John, we have the
testimony of an undoubted <span style="white-space:nowrap;">eye-witness—not</span> his
conclusions but his account of facts in respect
to which he could not well be <span style="white-space:nowrap;">deceived—certainly</span>
not, unless we are prepared to believe that Jesus
was himself a deliberate deceiver; testimony of
an eye-witness whose honesty not even the most
resolute skepticism would or could well call in
question. This testimony would establish beyond
question such facts as the miraculous feeding
of the five thousand, the healing of the man
born blind, the resurrection of Lazarus, and the
death and resurrection of Jesus himself. In
other words, it would establish beyond the possibility
of reasonable question, the truth of
historical Christianity. Accordingly, Renan, who
to a certain extent accepts the authenticity of
the Fourth Gospel, is compelled to maintain that
the pretended resurrection of Lazarus was a
pious fraud to which Jesus lent himself because
it was necessary to the success of his mission,
and because his growing religious enthusiasm
justified to his conscience this means, for the
sake of the end to be accomplished by it. Moreover,
we have in this Gospel a report of words of
Jesus, which leave to us no alternative but to
accept him as in a peculiar sense the Son of
God, or to regard him either as a religious
impostor or a religious enthusiast. The synoptics
leave some opportunity for discussion as to
the place which Jesus assumed to fill. The
Fourth Gospel does not. Thus the question of
the authorship of this Gospel is not merely a
question in literary criticism, but even more one
respecting the nature of Christianity. Accordingly
we find, on the one hand, the advocates
of its apostolic authorship more or less resting
their belief upon the inherent beauty of the
book, and the opponents more or less declaring
the true ground of their opposition to it, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>,
that it presents what they call a mythological
view of Jesus, and a dogmatic view of his
teachings; in other words, that it presents
Jesus distinctively as the incarnate Son of God,
and represents the central truth in his teaching
to have been the necessity of faith in him. Both
these aspects of truth are indeed presented in
the other Gospels, but not with the same clearness,
nor with the same prominence, as in the
Fourth Gospel. Hence the latter is assailed
with peculiar vigor by the opponents of evangelical
Christianity, and is, for the same reason,
maintained with equal vigor by evangelical
believers. It does not come within the province
of this work to enter into the details of
this controversy. To give the arguments, pro
and con, would require a treatise, and for a
consideration of them the reader is of necessity
referred to the various works which have been
written on this subject. The student will find
the most vigorous assault on the authenticity
of the Fourth Gospel in the second volume
of “Supernatural Religion,” which, however,
must be read with considerable allowance for a
scholarship evidently warped by determined
prejudices, and which is certainly one-sided,
if not absolutely false in many particulars.
Among the many defences of the authenticity
of the Gospel, I have found nothing more comprehensive
or satisfactory than that contained in
the first volume of Godet’s Commentary on John.
With this, however, may be advantageously
compared Luthardt’s “<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John, the Author
of the Fourth Gospel,” <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Fisher’s “Supernatural
Origin of Christianity,” and the introductions
to the commentaries, especially those
of Luthardt, Lange, Alford, Meyer and Tholuck.
Here I propose merely to set before the
reader briefly a compact statement of the more
important facts in the case, confining myself
mainly to those that are <span style="white-space:nowrap;">undisputed—facts</span>
which led the world for fifteen centuries to
attribute the Fourth Gospel to John without a

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
doubt, and which on a more careful examination
have led the great majority of scholars to adhere
to that conclusion.</p>

<p><b>The Apostle John.</b> The Apostle John was
probably a native, certainly a resident, of Galilee.
His mother, Salome,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
early became a follower
of Jesus. She was probably one of the women
of Galilee who accompanied him on his missionary
tours, and ministered to him of their substance.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
She was with him on his last journey
to Jerusalem, and during the passion week, and
was one of those women who were last at the
cross and first at the sepulchre.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Like the other
followers of Jesus, she anticipated the establishment
of a temporal kingdom, was ambitious for
her sons James and John, and made an application
for special favors for them when the kingdom
should be established. From a comparison
of <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 27:56 with John
<a href="#ch19_25">19:25</a>, it would
appear that she was own sister to the Virgin
Mary, in which case John was own cousin to
Jesus. This opinion is not accepted by all
critics, but I believe it to be the correct one.
See note on John <a href="#ch19_25">19:25</a>. John’s father, Zebedee,
was a well-to-do fisherman on the shores of
the sea of Galilee. Of him we know very little.
He was sufficiently prosperous to own several
boats and to hire men to work for him. Tradition
makes him of noble birth; and this tradition
is perhaps confirmed by the fact that John had
some acquaintance with the high-priest.</p>

<p>John has been characterized by those critics
who wish to make out that his character is inconsistent
with the idea of his authorship of the
Fourth Gospel, as ignorant and unlettered, on
the authority of Acts 4:13, and as a vehement
and bigoted Jew on the authority of Galatians,
<abbr title="chapter">chap.</abbr> <abbr title="Two">II</abbr>,
and of the peculiar Hebraic tone of the
Book of Revelation. Both characterizations are
quite gratuitous assumptions. In connection with
every Jewish synagogue was a parochial school,
in which the pupils were taught reading, writing,
and the rudiments of such natural sciences
as were then in existence. The Jewish children
of the common people were far better educated
than those of Greece or Rome. There is every
reason to believe that John received this common
education of the age and community in
which he lived, and there is absolutely no reason
whatever to suppose the contrary. It was only
by the Pharisees that John was considered as
ignorant and unlettered, and they affixed the
same stigma upon Jesus himself.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
To the Pharisees
the only learning worth the name was
learning in the traditional lore of the church.
Of this the Galilean fisherman was ignorant. In
the eyes of a Pharisee of Jerusalem, Plato himself
would have been ignorant and unlearned.
As little reason is there to believe that John was
a vehement and bigoted Jew. There is not the
slightest evidence that John was among the
Judaizing Christians to whom Paul so frequently
refers, and whom throughout his life he combated.
With one exception, Judas Iscariot, all
the twelve were taken from Galilee. This province
of Palestine was innocent of that formalism
and narrowness which characterized the southern
province of Judea. The people had lived in
amicable relations with their heathen neighbors,
and had intermarried with them ever since the
days of the treaty of amity between Solomon
and the King of Tyre.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
The line of commerce
between Damascus and the Mediterranean lay
directly across this province. Mineral springs of
real or fancied value near the southern coast of
the Sea of Gennesaret made it the summer resort
of the wealthy Romans of the entire land. Thus
history and location, commerce and social relations,
combined to make the inhabitants of
Galilee indifferent to the rigid formalism of the
Judeans, and comparatively free from their
narrow race and religious prejudices. Indeed,
the two assertions that John was ignorant and
unlearned, and at the same time a narrow and
bigoted Jew, contradict each other. Jewish
bigotry and reverence for the traditional lore of
the Jewish church always went together.</p>

<p>The important facts in the history of John, so
far as known, are few and soon told. John the
Baptist was second cousin of Jesus, and John the
Apostle was probably, as we have seen, his own
cousin. The two Johns were, therefore, probably
acquainted. At all events, when the Baptist
began preaching the gospel of repentance for the
remission of sins, the Apostle was among his disciples;
and when the Baptist pointed out Jesus
as the one whom God had indicated to him as the
promised Messiah, John was among the first to
leave the old teacher to follow the new one.
This was, however, a temporary following only.
We next meet him fishing with his father at the
Sea of Galilee, where Jesus finds him and his
brother, and calls them to become permanent
followers of him. This summons, without hesitation
or delay, they obey. From this time onward
John is the constant companion of Jesus.
With Peter and James he belongs to an inner circle
of friends: the three are selected to be the
sole witnesses of the resurrection of Jairus’s
daughter; they alone go up into the Mount of
Transfiguration, and witness his glory there;
they alone accompany him to the Garden of
Gethsemane, and are invited to be the sharers of

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
his sorrow there; when the arrest takes place,
and all the disciples forsake their Master and
flee, John and Peter turn back and follow him to
the scene of his trial, and the former, with a
courage for which few critics give him credit,
goes without concealment, as a disciple, openly,
into the house of Caiaphas, follows the Master to
the trial before Pilate, and when the sentence of
crucifixion is pronounced, accompanies the procession
to the place of execution, to remain by
the cross till all is over. When the news of the
resurrection is brought to the disciples, he and
Peter are the first to reach the sepulchre. In the
subsequent history of the Church, as recorded in
the book of Acts, he does not take a prominent
part. To him was committed the care of Mary,
the mother of Jesus, and probably this sacred
charge prevented him from quitting Palestine
while she lived.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>For the subsequent history of John we are dependent
on tradition. This is, however, in his
case, less uncertain than in many other cases.
As Christianity spread over the heathen world,
Jerusalem ceased to be the centre of Christian
operations; but, while the Roman Empire continued
pagan and persecuting, Rome could not take
the place of Jerusalem, as subsequently it did.
Hence, for the first century, Asia Minor was the
great field of missionary work, and Ephesus,
which was the scene of Paul’s greatest triumphs
and most successful labors,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
became the centre of
the Christian church. Here John became settled
in his later life. From this point he seems to
have exercised an apostolic supervision over the
churches of all Asia Minor. The few traditional
stories of his old age accord with what the Gospels
indicate of his character. When he could
no longer preach, it is said that he was accustomed
to be carried into the church, and to
repeat from the pulpit as the sum and substance
of Christian doctrine, “Little children, love one
another!” He was banished to the island of
Patmos, where, according to the book of Revelation,
he witnessed the vision therein recorded.
He subsequently returned to Ephesus, where it is
probable he died at an extremely advanced <span style="white-space:nowrap;">age—not</span>
much, if any, less than a hundred years old.</p>

<p><b>The character of John</b> has been strangely
misconceived. He is with reason identified with
the unnamed “disciple whom Jesus loved,” and
who at the Last Supper rested his head on Jesus’
bosom; the Epistles attributed to him breathe a
spirit of love; the Gospel attributed to him is of
all the Gospels the most spiritual in its tone.
From these premises, the character of John has
been constructed; it has been supposed that he
was by nature peculiarly tender, gentle, loving,
and spiritually-minded; that his was a woman’s
character. He is so portrayed in art, and to some
extent in literature; and the special friendship
which Christ has been supposed to have entertained
for him is attributed to a character by
nature peculiarly loveable.</p>

<p>There are, however, other considerations which
any such view totally ignores. James and John
were by Jesus called Boanerges, “the sons of
thunder;” it was John who prohibited a strange
disciple from casting out devils in Jesus’ name,
because he followed not the Twelve; it was John
who desired to call down fire from Heaven upon
the Samaritan village which refused to entertain
his Master; it was James and John who, with
their mother, applied secretly to Jesus for the
highest offices for themselves in his anticipated
kingdom; it was John who followed Jesus into
the courtyard of the high-priest, when all the
other disciples forsook him and fled; John who
stood with the Galilean women near the cross at
the time of the crucifixion; John who with Peter
defied the edict of the Sanhedrim after the death
of Jesus, prohibiting them from teaching or
speaking in his name.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
These are not the acts
of one whose nature was characteristically timid,
gentle, or spiritually-minded. By nature John
was ardent, courageous, impetuous, and not
more broad-minded or spiritually-minded than
his co-disciples. Indications of these traits are
not wanting, as we shall presently see, in the
Gospel and the Epistles which bear his name.</p>

<p>But he was of all the Twelve the most receptive.
When Christ foretold his passion, Peter
remonstrated with him. When Jesus spoke of
the heavenly mansions and of his departure to
prepare a place therein for his disciples, Thomas
expressed his doubt and his perplexity by the
question, “We know not whither thou goest, and
how can we know the way?” When Jesus
pointed to himself as the manifestation of the
Father, Philip, dissatisfied, asked for a direct
revelation of the Father. When Jesus promised
to his disciples a spiritual manifestation of himself,
Judas (not Iscariot), after the manner of
modern theology, desired to have that manifestation
explained to him before he could accept
the truth. When Jesus rebuked Judas Iscariot
for complaining of Mary’s act in anointing her
Lord, Judas was angered.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
But we look in vain
in the Gospels for any instance in which John
expressed any rebuke of Christ, or any opposition
to him, or any doubt of his teaching, or demanded
any other evidence of its truth than the
simple word of his Lord. Of all the disciples the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
most receptive, he was the one whose character
underwent the greatest and most radical change.
The John that we know is the John transformed
by the renewing influence of the spirit of Christ;
he is the John that is a new creature in Christ
Jesus. He was, I believe, the beloved disciple,
because he was the one in whom the love of
Christ had the freest course and wrought the
fullest and the largest results. This simple fact
must be borne in mind in considering the question
of the internal evidences for and against the
Johannine authorship of the Gospel.</p>

<p><b>The external evidence.</b> Those who expect
to find a demonstration of the Johannine authorship
of the Fourth Gospel in the external evidences,
will be disappointed. The literature of
the first three centuries does not afford a demonstration
of authorship of any ancient book. But
the authorship of John’s Gospel I believe to be
as well established, on a fair consideration of all
the evidence, external and internal, as that of any
work of the same era.</p>

<p>It is not questioned by any one that at the beginning
of the third century the Fourth Gospel
was in general use in the churches, and universally
recognized as written by the Apostle John.
Eusebius, Origen, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria,
are among those who bear testimony to
this fact. The Fourth Gospel is recognized as
John’s composition in the canon of Muratori,
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 175; and by Irenæus, who died about 202,
and who was a pupil of Polycarp, himself a pupil
of John. References to sayings of Jesus reported
only by John are also found in the writings of
Tatian, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 170, Justin
Martyr, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 120-160,
and the various Gnostic writers of the second
century. These references do not conclusively
prove the Johannine authorship of the Fourth
Gospel, for these earliest writers are not accustomed
to give the names of authors from whom
they quote; but they do conclusively prove that
as early as the first part of the second century,
sayings of Christ, found only in the Fourth Gospel,
were attributed by the Church to Jesus.
The best report of these quotations which I have
seen is to be found in the second volume of
“Supernatural Religion,” and they are there the
more effective because the author in vain endeavors
to break their force, by what most
readers will consider an ingenious but ineffective
special pleading. Let the reader compare these
quotations with the parallel passages in the Fourth
Gospel; he will not doubt that the later writers
borrowed from the earlier one. The only alternative
is the irrational hypothesis that both borrowed
from the same source and one generally
recognized in the primitive Church; in other
words, that there was a Gospel containing the
same matter that is now found in the Fourth
Gospel, but that it has so entirely disappeared
that no tradition even of its existence has survived,
and that in its place a forgery has been
palmed off upon the Church so successfully, that
in the beginning of the third century it was universally
accepted as the original work of the
Apostle whose name it has ever since borne.</p>

<p>Space does not allow me to give in detail these
quotations, which are numerous; it would be
still more out of the province of this introduction
to enter into the arguments by which the rationalistic
writers endeavor to reconcile these quotations
with their hypotheses. I can but briefly
indicate a few of them, referring the student to
the larger works for the examination in detail of
the parallelism between these early ecclesiastical
writers and the Fourth Gospel. Justin Martyr
thus refers to the testimony of John the Baptist:
“I am not the Christ ... for he cometh who is
stronger than I, whose shoes I am not meet to
bear” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
John 1:19-27</span>). He cites Christ as saying,
“Unless ye be born again, ye shall not
enter into the kingdom of heaven,” and adds the
comment, “Now that it is impossible for those
who have been born to go into the matrices of
the mother is evident to all”
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
John <a href="#ch3_3">3:3-5</a></span>).
Tatian refers to the sayings, “The darkness
comprehends not the light”
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
John <a href="#ch1_5">1:5</a></span>), and
“All things were by him, and without him was
not anything made” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
John <a href="#ch1_5">1:5</a>, <a href="#ch1_3">3</a></span>). Hegessippus
(<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 125) refers to “that which is
spoken in the Gospels, ‘That was the true light
which lighteth every man who cometh into the
world’” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
John <a href="#ch1_9">1:9</a></span>). In the writings of the
Naaseni and Peratæ, Gnostic sects of the beginning
of the second century, we have several
unmistakable references to sayings that are peculiar
to the Fourth Gospel. “I am the door,”
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> John
<a href="#ch10_7">10:7</a></span>); “As Moses lifted up the serpent
in the wilderness, even so must the Son be
lifted up,” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> John
<a href="#ch3_14">3:14</a></span>); “If thou hadst
known who it is that asketh thee, thou wouldest
have asked of him, and he would have given
thee living water, springing up,” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
John 4:10</span>);
“The Saviour hath said, ‘That which is born
of flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the
Spirit is spirit,’” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
John <a href="#ch3_6">3:6</a></span>); “Except ye
eat my flesh and drink my blood, ye shall not
enter the kingdom of heaven,” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
John <a href="#ch6_53">6:53</a></span>).
These are by no means all the citations from
the writers of the first two centuries which
appear to have been taken from the Fourth Gospel,
but they will suffice to give the reader an
idea of the nature of the evidence which is regarded
by most Christian writers, and by some
rationalistic <span style="white-space:nowrap;">critics—Matthew</span> Arnold, for <span style="white-space:nowrap;">example—as</span>
establishing the fact that the Fourth
Gospel was in existence and recognized as an
authority in the Church in the beginning of the
second century. If this is the fact, it is reasonably
certain that it was the work of the Apostle

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
John, since if it had been written by any one else
as early as that date, that is, during the lifetime
of some of the contemporaries of John, the forgery
would certainly have been detected.</p>

<p><b>The internal evidence.</b> The facts indicated
above are not questioned by any critic. But
though from the beginning of the third century
to the close of the eighteenth, the Fourth Gospel
was unanimously attributed to the Apostle John,
it is maintained by those critics who deny the
Johannine authorship that a fair consideration of
the external evidence now extant, leaves it uncertain
whether the unanimous opinion of the
Church in the first century was correct, and that
the internal evidence, <i>i. e.</i>, the character of the
Gospel itself, when contrasted (1) with the other
Gospels, (2) with the known character of John,
(3) with the other writings attributed to him,
makes it certain that he was not the author.</p>

<p>Unquestionably the Fourth Gospel presents
very different matter and a very different aspect
of Christ’s life and character from that presented
by the other three Gospels. The three Gospels
give an impression almost exclusively Galilean;
the Fourth Gospel narrates almost exclusively a
ministry in Judea; the three Gospels indicate
one which might have been completed in a single
year; the fourth indicates three years as the
duration of Christ’s ministry; the three Gospels
report chiefly Christ’s ethical discourses; the
fourth reports chiefly his doctrinal discourses;
love to men’s neighbor is the predominate theme
in the three Gospels; faith in a divine Saviour is
the predominate theme in the fourth; the three
Gospels portray the work of Jesus Christ; the
fourth portrays his person and character; the
three Gospels repeat the same incidents and
instructions in slightly different language; the
fourth repeats scarcely anything found in the
other three; and when, as in its account of the
feeding of the five thousand, it does repeat, the
manifest object of the repetition is to introduce
a report of a discourse of Jesus omitted in the
other narratives.</p>

<p>It is also true that there is a marked difference
between the style of John’s Gospel and the Book
of Revelations. This difference is so considerable
that it is vigorously maintained that the
same author could not have written both books.
“The difference,” says Lucke, “between the
language, way of expression and mode of
thought and doctrine of the Apocalypse and
the rest of the Johannine writings is so comprehensive
and intense, so individual and even so
radical; the affinity and agreement on the contrary
either so general, or in detail so fragmentary
and uncertain, that the Apostle John, if he really
is the author of the Gospel and of the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Epistles—which</span>
we here <span style="white-space:nowrap;">advance—cannot</span> have composed
the Apocalypse either before or after the Gospel
and the Epistles.” This difference is of two
kinds, a difference both of style and of spirit.
The language of the Apocalypse is comparatively
harsh and Hebraic, that of the Gospel a comparatively
fine and flowing Greek. The author of
the Apocalypse, it is claimed, is an intense Jew,
whose imagery is borrowed from the Hebrew
Scriptures, and whose object is the exaltation
of the Jewish people; who narrates the outpoured
punishment of God on the enemies of
God’s chosen people, and whose celestial capital
of the kingdom without end is the new Jerusalem.
The author of the Fourth Gospel, it is
claimed, could not have been a Jew or of Jewish
extraction; he makes no attempt to conceal his
enmity of the Jews; he stigmatizes them as the
enemies of Christ, and as the children of the
devil;<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
and he writes of them and of their
customs as no Jew would or could have written
of the customs of his own people.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>It is not my purpose here to enter upon a
discussion of these objections. It must suffice
to say that they are founded on a false conception
of the character of John and a false assumption
that what John was when he first met Jesus
by the banks of the Jordan, that he was after a
life-time spent as a disciple, learning of him and
undergoing that transformation of character
which has been the peculiar and glorious fruitage
of Christ’s husbandry. Instead of entering
into such a discussion, I shall ask the reader to
consider briefly what are some of the more notable
characteristics of the Fourth Gospel, and what
would be the conclusion as to its authorship
from an independent and original examination
of its pages.</p>

<p>Imagine then that we have just discovered this
ancient manuscript, a manuscript which unquestionably
dates from the beginning of the third
century, probably from a still earlier period, and
which we have abundant evidence was then
unanimously attributed to the Apostle John.
We enter upon its examination that we may
form for ourselves a judgment who its real
author probably was. In this examination there
are three characteristics which force themselves
upon our attention as predominant: (1) the
claims which it presents; (2) its literary character;
(3) the indications which it affords as to
the personality of its author.</p>

<p><b>1. Its claims.</b> It assumes to be written by an
eye-witness. In his introduction the writer says
distinctly of the subject of his biography: “We
beheld his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten
of the Father.” In the Epistle attributed to him,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
he reiterates this statement even more explicitly.
“That which was from the beginning, which we
have heard, which we have seen with our eyes,
which we have looked upon and our hands have
handled of the word of life ... that which we
have seen and heard declare we unto you.” In
his account of the crucifixion he emphasizes the
fact that he is an eye-witness of the events described.
“He that saw it bare record and the
record is true; and he knoweth that he saith
true that ye might believe.” And yet again in
the closing chapter, generally regarded as written
subsequent to the rest of the volume, and as
supplementary to it, the writer is identified with
the unnamed beloved disciple. “This is the
disciple who testified of these things and wrote
these things, and we know that his testimony is
true.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In reading the book we constantly come upon
indications that the work is by an eye-witness or
by one who writes in order to give that impression.
No one of the Evangelist’s narratives more
abounds with graphic touches, slight but significant,
such as indicate the vivid remembrance of
one who was not only an eye and ear witness,
but also one who treasures up in a remarkably
retentive memory incidents which mere tradition
would not have preserved. John the Baptist
“looks upon Jesus,” and points him out
to his disciples, by his peculiar gaze; Jesus
“turns” and sees them follow; wearied with
the journey he sits “thus on the well;” there
is “much grass” where he feeds the five thousand;
when Mary anointed Jesus the “house
was filled with the odor of the ointment;” when
Judas went out to complete the betrayal “it was
night;” the night “was cold,” and Peter stands
with the servant of the high-priest warming
himself at a fire of coals in the court-yard.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
These may serve as illustrations. Examples the
reader will find in great abundance, and references
to them in the notes. Of all the Gospels,
the Fourth Gospel is the one which reports most
fully the private conferences between Jesus and
the Twelve, and the only one which reports his
“asides” and his personal feelings in explanation
of his public acts.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
These features in the narrative
do not prove that it was written by an
eye-witness, but they indicate that it was written
either by an eye-witness, or by one who desired
to produce that impression; either by one of
the Twelve or by a deliberate and skilful forger.</p>

<p><b>2. Its literary character.</b> The differences
between this Gospel and the other three which I
have already very briefly described, are very considerable.
They have led different minds to very
different conclusions respecting the authorship of
the Fourth Gospel. It is, however, safe to say
that they are just such as might be expected if
the Fourth Gospel was written after the other
three, and by some one familiar with them, or at
least with the traditions embodied in them. This
Gospel presents precisely the aspect which would
be presented by a book written for the purpose of
supplementing the accounts already possessed
by the primitive churches, and of portraying an
aspect of character not adequately portrayed by
the earlier writers. It presents, too, exactly
that aspect which would be presented by a
narrative written after the rapid growth of the
Church, and its prophetic incursions into heathenism
had given the writer a better conception
than his co-disciples possessed of the spiritual
character of the new religion. Matthew, Mark,
and Luke might perhaps have believed that the
privileges of Christianity were to be confined to
Jews and Jewish proselytes. Though many of
Christ’s words which they report indicate a
broader scope, it is by no means clear that they
comprehended them. But no one can doubt
that the author of John’s Gospel, when he
wrote, believed that the atonement of Jesus
Christ was for all humanity, his religion for all
classes, races, and conditions of mankind. It is
the Fourth Gospel which tells us that He was
the true Light which lighteth <em>every man</em> which
cometh into the world, that God so loved the
<em>world</em> that he gave his only beloved Son that
whosoever believeth in him should have everlasting
life, and that <em>whosoever</em> comes to him he
will in no wise cast out; it is the Fourth Gospel
which reports Christ’s interview with the woman
of Samaria and his subsequent preaching to the
Samaritans, which brings out more clearly than
either of the others the grounds of Christ’s
practical abrogation of the Pharisaic law of the
Sabbath, which dwells more than any other
Gospel on the spiritual aspects of his kingdom
and the divine nature of the king.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
All this
we might expect from one writing after more
than half a century of Catholic Christianity had
interpreted the nature, mission, and words of
Christ to his church.</p>

<p>Let us add that a forger would not have suffered
his narrative to stand in such a marked
contrast with the previous and recognized narratives
already in the possession of the churches.
He would have commingled the ethical with the
doctrinal, the human with the divine. He would
have repeated in a modified form some of the
incidents and teachings already reported by the
other Evangelists, that he might thus give a
color of authenticity to his narrative. The very
contrast between the Fourth Gospel and the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
other three, on which skeptic writers rely to
prove its untrustworthiness, is an indication
that it cannot be the work of fraud. If that
aspect of Christ’s character and teachings reported
by John’s Gospel was not recognized by
the primitive church as true, or if the author
was not himself known in the age in which the
narrative was produced, and so known that his
simple name was a sufficient guarantee of the
accuracy of his narrative, an account so dissimilar
from those already in the possession of the
churches would have received little credit and
no general, certainly no universal, acceptance.</p>

<p><b>3. Indications of authorship.</b> A further
examination of this Gospel gives a definite impression
respecting the character of the author.
He is evidently thoroughly familiar with Jewish
manners and customs. He knows whereof he
writes. He has lived in the country and mingled
with the people. His knowledge is not that of
a student of books, nor that of a mere casual
traveler. But he writes for those who are not
familiar with Palestine or its social life. He
inserts parenthetical explications of Jewish customs.
He explains to his Gentile readers the
use of the firkins of water at the wedding-feast
“for purifying after the manner of the Jews;”
the wrapping of the body of Jesus, as the manner
of the “Jews is to bury;” the refusal of
the Pharisees to enter Pilate’s hall “lest they
should be defiled.” The feast of Tabernacles is
the Jews’ feast of Tabernacles, the Passover is
the Jews’ Passover, and the Preparation for it
is the Preparation of the Jews.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
These references
are so incidental as to indicate a writer
thoroughly familiar with Jewish life; yet they
are so marked as to indicate equally clearly a
writer whose readers were not Jews but Gentiles.</p>

<p>The indications are not less clear that the
writer, whoever he may have been, was not
himself a sharer in Jewish prejudices. Jew he
may have been; an intolerant Jew he certainly
was not. He is familiar with the Pharisees and
with the Pharisaic law, but he has no sympathy
with the one and no admiration for the other.
We can hardly be mistaken in thinking that his
native prejudices are adverse rather than favorable
to the inhabitants of Judea. More than any
of the other Evangelists his language respecting
them indicates his aversion to them. He is the
Evangelist who reports the mobs in Jerusalem
against Jesus, and the secret counsels for his
assassination, and the deliberate judgment of
Caiaphas that it is better for the rulers to kill
the Galilean Rabbi than to hazard their own
offices, and the persistent persecution of Jesus;
he it is who with delicate sarcasm stigmatizes
Caiaphas as high-priest for “that same year;”
the very language which he employs in describing
the religious festivals of Judea as “feasts of
the Jews,” indicates an author not in sympathy
with the religious formalism of Judea; the very
phraseology with which he characterizes the
reluctance of the Jews to enter into Pilate’s
judgment-hall, indicates a writer having little
sympathy for the formalism which was never a
characteristic of the Galilean Jews, and always
was a characteristic of the more intense and
bigoted Jews of the Syrian province of Judea.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Nor can we be mistaken in surmising that the
author was, by nature and temperament, ardent,
impulsive, vehement. The intensity of his nature
has been tamed by age, experience or grace, or
the three combined; but the indications of his
native character crop out in occasional utterances.
The records of Matthew, Mark, and
Luke are absolutely colorless. They are without
epithets. Their simple and artless narrative
is left to produce its own impression. This
is less true of the Fourth Gospel than of the
other three. The intense indignation which the
writer feels against Judas Iscariot, he is at no
pains to conceal. He it is who reports Jesus as
declaring early in his ministry, One of you is a
devil; he it is who characterizes Judas Iscariot
as a thief; he who twice declares that Satan
entered into Judas Iscariot.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
These are the
most notable exhibitions of his feelings; but one
can hardly read through the entire narrative
without realizing in its tone and spirit the evidence
that the author was a man of intense and
passionate earnestness, kept under marvelous
self-restraint.</p>

<p>Finally, it is clear that the author is a man of
some native capacity for culture and of large
education. He is familiar with the Greek language
and with the Greco-Oriental philosophy.
He writes with a pure and flowing style. His
introduction could have been penned only by
one who had become habituated to those forms
of philosophic thought which some cities of
Greece, and notably Ephesus, had imported
from Alexandria and the further East. It could
only have been written for readers who were
familiar with that philosophy and could best be
approached by employing its phraseology.</p>

<p>We find then in the direct claims and the incidental
allusions of the Fourth Gospel indications
that it was written by an eye and ear witness,
who was with Jesus from the commencement to
the close of his ministry; in the broad differences
between the Fourth Gospel and the other three
gospels, indications that it was written after the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
others and by one who was familiar with them or
with the traditions embodied in them, and who
wrote to supplement their accounts; in the general
catholic and spiritual atmosphere of the
book, indications that it was written after history
had begun to interpret the words and work of
Christ, and to make clearer his transcendent and
incomparable character; and in the style and
phraseology of the book, indications that it was
written by one who was familiar with Jewish customs
but not sharing Jewish prejudices, who
possessed an ardent nature which had been
brought under the power of a strong self-control,
and who to a native capacity for culture added
that familiarity with Greek literature and philosophy
which only long residence in a thoroughly
Greek society could impart.</p>

<p>Now, so far as our limited knowledge enables
us to judge, John’s life and character remarkably
correspond with these indications of the Gospel
which was so long unanimously attributed to his
pen. His parents were well-to-do Galileans, and
he probably received a fair education in his childhood;
his early education as a Galilean would
have given him familiarity with Jewish customs,
and yet would prejudice him against rather than
in favor of the inhabitants of Judea; his later
and prolonged residence in Ephesus, of all Greek
cities the most Oriental, would have made him
familiar with the best Greek culture, and with
the mystic philosophy of the Greco-Oriental
school; that he possessed a vehement nature is
evident from his original title of Son of Thunder;
his receptive disposition and his intense love for
Jesus might have been expected to tame that
nature, without eradicating from his writings all
indications of its existence; of all the disciples the
most courageous and the most sympathetically
intimate with the subject of his biography, he
was of them all the one to adhere to Jesus in his
dangerous ministry in Jerusalem, and the one
therefore to record what all the others have
omitted; he was also the one to interpret Christ’s
actions by his own suggestion of Christ’s unuttered
thoughts; writing after the other Gospels
had been written and were already being widely
circulated, his omission of events and teachings
which they had recorded is not only explicable,
but natural and to be anticipated; finally, writing
after the destruction of Jerusalem, after the dispersion
of the Jews had begun, after the descent
of the Holy Spirit had interpreted the mystical
promises of another Comforter, after churches
had been organized as far west as Rome in which
Gentile and Jew met on equal terms, after, in a
word, the history of the church had interpreted
the prophecies and instructions of its Lord, it
would have been strange indeed if he had not
given a deeper, truer, and more catholic exposition
of Christ’s Gospel than could have been
written during the first half-century in Palestine,
by those whose comprehension of Christ’s,
teaching had not been broadened by residence
in a foreign land and an observation of Christ’s
redeeming work in a pagan community.</p>

<p><b>Other hypotheses.</b> The conclusion to which
a consideration of the external and internal evidence
brings the candid student is confirmed by
a consideration of the alternative hypotheses
presented to him. These are many in form; for
it is a significant fact that while those who believe
in the authenticity of the Fourth Gospel are
entirely agreed in respect to its authorship, and
the time and place of its composition, those who
disbelieve in its authenticity are not agreed
among themselves respecting either. But in general
their various opinions may be reduced to two
classes.</p>

<p>The first is that the Fourth Gospel is the work
of a Gentile Christian writing in the third century.
Confessedly this Gospel purports to be
written by an eye and ear witness. Confessedly
it was unanimously attributed to the Apostle
John in the third century. Confessedly it is
without a peer in literature, ancient or modern,
sacred or secular, Christian or pagan, in the
purity of its doctrine, the moral elevation of its
style, and the spirituality of its atmosphere.
This hypothesis asks us to believe that it is the
work of a deliberate ecclesiastical forger, with
so little conscience that he neither hesitated to
assume the pen of an Apostle nor to attribute to
Jesus fictitious discourses and imaginary miracles,
yet with so much conscience that he would
not put an Apostle’s name to his composition,
but left its authorship to be inferred by a self-deluded
public; written too by a forger who was
so skillful that he deceived the whole contemporaneous
church, all sects and sections, Jewish
and Gentile, Greek, Roman, and African, orthodox
and heretic, and yet who was such a bungler
that the gross discrepancies of his account, contrasted
with that of the other three evangelists,
make his fraud palpable to the ecclesiastical and
literary critics of the nineteenth century. This
hypothesis demands so great an exercise of credulity
that sober critics of even the rationalistic
school are generally abandoning it, or have already
done so. This opinion may be already
characterized as a thing of the past.</p>

<p>The other hypothesis is more plausible and
captivating. This is that the Fourth Gospel was
written by an amanuensis or a disciple of the
Apostle John, that its essential facts were derived
from him, that it was written in his old age, that
his recollection was already growing dim and his
reports of the words of Jesus are unconsciously
modified by his philosophy and experience, and
that these reports are still further modified by
the free pen of the amanuensis or the disciple

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
who perfected the written record; and it is
urged that this hypothesis explains both verbal
peculiarities and the title given to it from early
ages, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, not the Gospel of John, but the Gospel
according to John.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>In support of this opinion there is quoted an
ancient legend found in the canon of Muratori
(<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 175), which runs as follows: “The fourth
of the Gospels is by the disciple John. He was
being pressed by his disciples and (fellow) bishops,
and he said, ‘Fast with me this day, and for
three days; and whatsoever shall have been revealed
to each one of us, let us relate it to the
rest.’ In the same night it was revealed to the
Apostle Andrew that John should write the
whole in his name, and that all the rest should
revise it.” It must suffice to say of this opinion
that in its most pronounced form it is wholly unsustained
by evidence. It is ingenious, but not
substantial. Doubtless the reports of Christ’s
disciples are not verbatim. Doubtless we have
in many instances the sentiments of Christ embodied
in the words of John. Possibly some
glosses and explanations added originally by an
amanuensis or scribe may have become incorporated
in the narrative.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
But that the book is in no
sense a composite production, that it is the work
of one not of many minds, that we have essentially
the portrayal of the life and character of
Jesus by a single author, is evident on even a
casual perusal, and still more on a careful analysis
of the work.</p>

<p><b>Discourses of Jesus.</b> The Gospel of John
abounds with reports of the discourses of Jesus;
it is more a report of his discourses (<span lang="el">λόγια</span>) than
of his works (<span lang="el">ἔργα</span>); the miracles reported are generally
only a text for a discourse which follows.
The student, passing from the Sermon on the
Mount in Matthew, or the parables in Perea, in
Luke, to the sermon on the Bread of life at Capernaum
(<span class="muchsmaller">John, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#CHAPTER_VI">6</a></span>), or on the Good Shepherd, at
Jerusalem (<span class="muchsmaller">John, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#CHAPTER_X">10</a></span>), feels the difference between
them, a difference chiefly in the phraseology employed,
sometimes in the phases of truth taught,
but never amounting to a contradiction in the essential
teaching. The same doctrine respecting
the authority of Christ is conveyed by <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 11:27,
and John <a href="#ch5_19">5:19-30</a>; the same truth as to the
nature and necessity of a new and divine life in the
soul is expressed in Mark 4:26-29, and in John
<a href="#ch6_50">6:50-58</a>; similar parallels in essential truth may
be found in the synoptics to all that is taught in
the Fourth Gospel; but the form of expression is
strikingly different. Thus, in the study of the
Fourth Gospel, the question is constantly pressed
upon the student, how far the reports of Christ’s
addresses by John are to be regarded as reported
in the words of Christ.</p>

<p>In answer to this we have, on the one hand,
Christ’s promise reported by John: “The Comforter
... shall bring all things to your remembrance
whatsoever I have said unto you” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_26">14:26</a></span>); on the other, we have reason to believe
that the reports are not verbatim. (<i>a</i>) This
would require a supernatural exercise of memory
nowhere claimed by the Evangelists, and
therefore not to be claimed by the church for
them. (<i>b</i>) In some instances, <i>e. g.</i>, the case of
the conversation with Nicodemus and the woman
at the well, it is certain that John could not have
been present, and must have derived his information
either from Jesus or from the other
party to the conference. (<i>c</i>) The language in
which the discourse is reported is analogous
not only in words, but also in the forms of expression
to that of the narrator; the likeness is
so marked that in several instances the critics are
not fully agreed how much is to be regarded as
the discourse of Jesus, and how much as the accompanying
comment of John. (<i>d</i>) The thought
is sometimes, and the language is often, obscure.
And though this obscurity is increased by mistranslations,
and by the division into verses, which
hides from the reader the true unity of the discourse,
nevertheless it exists in the Greek original.
Such obscurity does not exist in the reports of
Christ’s discourses in the other Gospels. (<i>e</i>) The
largest public discourse as reported would not
have required over eight minutes in delivery. I
believe then that in the Fourth Gospel we have
the substantial thoughts of Christ, reproduced
generally in the words and with the phraseology
of John, whose mind, under the divine inspiration,
preserves the essential truth unimpaired, but represents
it, not as a mechanical repeater of words,
but as a disciple who freely reproduces the ideas
of his Master, but largely in language of his own.</p>

<p><b>Object and character.</b> We are not left to
surmise the object of the author of the Fourth
Gospel. He himself tells us what it was: “These
are written that ye might believe that Jesus is
the Christ, the Son of God, and that, believing,
ye might have life through his name.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>According to John’s Gospel, true religion consists
not in obedience to an external law, but in a
new life in the soul, by which it is transformed,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
and the soul, its habits and character, are brought
into conformity with the law of God, that is, the
law of love. This new and divine life is implanted
supernaturally from above; it is fed perpetually
by the influence of the divine Spirit; it
emancipates the soul from all bondage to sin and
the law; for it preparation is made by the life
and death of the Lord; in it God is manifested
in a peculiar manner to the soul and abides with
it, an indwelling Comforter. This life comes
through a vital faith in Jesus as in a peculiar
sense the Son of God, in whose life the believer
finds his ideal of true life, by whose death he is
redeemed from death, by whose spiritual power
he is raised a new creature in Christ Jesus, by
whose abiding presence he is guided, guarded,
strengthened, fed. Those incidents and discourses
in the life of Christ which illustrate and
enforce this aspect of Christian truth and experience
are those which John gives us in his Gospel.
The other Gospels represent the duties of
the disciples, John their privileges; the other
Gospels bid them what they ought to do, John
points them to what they can become; the other
Gospels represent Christ chiefly as a Saviour
coming to seek and to save that which is lost,
John as a Friend abiding with his own; in the
other Gospels he is a Shepherd in the wilderness,
in John the Shepherd in the fold; in the other
Gospels the Son is either still in the far country
or but just returning to his Father’s home, in
John he has returned and is abiding in his
Father’s love. In the other Gospels, therefore,
Jesus is chiefly represented as a divine teacher,
in John as a recognized Saviour; in the other
Gospels as the Son of man, in John as the Son of
God; in the other Gospels we have seen him as
he appears to the wanderer, in John as he is interpreted
by the heart of the saved; in the other
Gospels the bridegroom is coming for his bride
and is still the Unknown; in John he has taken
her to himself, and her love at least dimly recognizes
in him the One among ten thousand and
altogether lovely.</p>

<p>These aspects of truth may be easily discerned
in even a brief survey of the Fourth Gospel.</p>

<p>John opens his narrative by an introduction, in
which he borrows the mystical language of Oriental
philosophy to characterize Jesus, whom he
describes as the Life, the Light, the Word; he
reports John the Baptist, not as the preacher of
the baptism of repentance, but as a prophet of
the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of
the world (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#CHAPTER_I">1</a></span>); in his account of the conversation
with Nicodemus (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#CHAPTER_III">3</a></span>), he points out the
origin of the spiritual life which Christ imparts
to the believer, “Ye must be born from above;”
in his report of the conversation with the Samaritan
woman, and of the discourse at Capernaum
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr>
<a href="#CHAPTER_IV">4</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">6</a></span>), he indicates the means by which
that life is sustained, by appropriating faith in
Christ; and in his record of the intermediate
discourse at Jerusalem (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#CHAPTER_V">5</a></span>), the basis for that
faith in Christ’s own portrayal of himself as the
Son and manifestation of God the Father; in his
report of the discourses in the Temple, he sets
forth in a different form the same truths.
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#CHAPTER_VII">7</a></span>),
declares the emancipation from bondage which
faith in the Son achieves for the soul, contrasts
it with the life of bondage unto sin
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">8</a></span>), and
describes the safety and security of the disciples,
a security purchased by the death of their Lord
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#CHAPTER_X">10</a></span>); he narrates the resurrection of Lazarus,
therein portraying Jesus as the resurrection and
the life (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#CHAPTER_XI">11</a></span>); he reports those words of Jesus at
the Last Supper, the full meaning of which no
Christian experience has ever yet fully sounded,
in which is promised to the believing disciple a
spiritual manifestation of God to the soul, an
abiding life of God in the soul, and a joyful realization
of all spiritual fullness in God by the soul
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr>
<a href="#CHAPTER_XIV">14</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_XV">15</a>,
<a href="#CHAPTER_XVI">16</a></span>); he records the only reported
intercessory prayer of the Lord for his disciples
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#CHAPTER_XVII">17</a></span>), the burden of which is, “As thou
Father art in me and I in you, that they also
may be one in us;” in the account of the Passion
he alone gives the short dialogue between
Jesus and Pilate, in which the Lord declares
himself a king and his kingdom one of everlasting
truth; and in his account of the resurrection
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#CHAPTER_XX">20</a></span>), he tells the story of Thomas’s unbelief and
of Christ’s warm commendation of “those who
have not seen and yet have believed.” Life
through <span style="white-space:nowrap;">faith—this</span> is the burden of John’s
Evangel; Jesus Christ the Life-giver, the disciple
of Jesus Christ the recipient of a new <span style="white-space:nowrap;">life—this</span>
is the good news which constitutes the
Fourth Gospel.</p>

<p><b>When and where and for whom written.</b>
A very ancient testimony, that of Irenæus, repeated
by Jerome and later writers, fixes the
place of publication at Ephesus. This accords
with the character of the Gospel itself. The
Oriental phraseology employed in the first chapter
especially, but also in less degree in other
portions of the Gospel, indicates that it was written
in a city where Oriental philosophy had a
strong hold; and of all Greek cities Ephesus was
the most Oriental. Moreover, an ancient and apparently
trustworthy tradition makes this city
the home of John in his later years. The time
of its composition is uncertain. Irenæus states
that it was the latest written of the four Gospels.
The character of the Gospel, as we have seen,
confirms this tradition. The book bears marks
of being written in old age; it is apparently
the production of a ripened Christian experience.
Alford fixes the date as between <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 70 and <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>
85; Macdonald, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 85 or 86; Godet, between
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 80 and 90; Tholuck, not far from <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 100.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Preliminary Note.</span>—The ordinary English
reader will find no difficulty in comprehending
the truths which John expresses in this introduction
to his Gospel, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, the pre-existence,
divine attributes, and divine nature of that
Jesus, the Messiah, of whom his book is written.
John identifies him with the Word, which
was with God from eternity, and with the Light
which lighteth every man that cometh into the
world. But it is not so clear why he should use
the peculiar and somewhat mysterious language
here employed; for the full understanding of
this, some historical explanation is necessary.
My object in this note is to afford very briefly
this historical explanation, as a basis for more
detailed consideration of particular words and
phrases in the notes.</p>

<p>From the earliest ages the ablest minds have
been perplexed by the problem how to reconcile
faith in an all-wise, all-powerful, and all-benevolent
Creator, with the fact of a creation full of
sin and suffering. One of the ablest thinkers of
modern times (John Stuart Mill) has declared
the problem insoluble, and from the facts of
creation has deduced the conclusion that the
Creator is neither all-wise, all-powerful, nor all-good;
to use his own words respecting the
Creator, “his wisdom is possibly, his power
certainly limited, and his goodness, though real,
is not likely to have been the only motive which
actuated him in the work of <span style="white-space:nowrap;">creation.”—(<cite>Three</cite></span>
<cite>Essays in Religion.</cite>) Oriental philosophy, pondering
this problem, proposed for its solution an
hypothesis which to a Western mind seems singularly
puerile and fantastic, and yet which, in
slightly different forms, gained, at one period in
the world’s history, an acceptance quite as widespread
as any form of philosophy or theology of
to-day. This hypothesis, however modified in
form, was in essence this, that the evil in the
world came not from the Creator, but from
some other and inferior Being. In the Persian
religion there were two deities, a good and an
evil god, Ormuzd and Ahriman, struggling with
each other for the supremacy. In the Chaldean
philosophy Light was the soul of the universe
and the Original First Cause; in the lower
realms, far below the space filled with pure and
unapproachable light, were darkness, night, and
all forth-springing evils, which either the Supreme
Light regarded it beneath his dignity to
contend with, or which were indestructible and
could only be confined within narrow limits, not
destroyed. In the Hindoo philosophy, the Great
First Cause, the beatific Brahm, lived in perpetual
repose, in a supreme and serene indifference to
all things. From him, by emanations, proceeded
lesser deities, and from these, by a process more
or less remote, a corrupt creation. At the
beginning of the Christian era, Alexandria,
founded by and named in honor of Alexander
the Great, was one of the intellectual centres of
the world. Here was gathered a library of over
700,000 volumes; here congregated Oriental
dreamers, Greek philosophers, and Jewish religionists.
Here, in the third century before
Christ, was translated into the Greek language
the Old Testament Scriptures. Here about 20
<span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, was born Philo, a Jew, of a priestly
family, a philosopher and <i lang="fr">litterateur</i>, and a voluminous
writer. He was not an original thinker;
his works are therefore all the more valuable as
a reflection of the current mystical philosophy
of his age and school. This dreamy philosophy
it is difficult to translate into modern forms of
thought. So far as this can be done, it may be
said to have involved the following statements:
God is simply the absolute, unchangeable Existence,
incomprehensible, inconceivable, yet ever
to be the object of our thoughts and meditations.
He could not come directly into contact with
matter without losing something of his ineffable
excellence. Hence he gave forth certain divine
powers or influences, “incorporeal potencies,”
which surround God as the members of a court
surround an earthly monarch. The highest of
these is the divine Logos or Word of God.
Through this Word the world was created,
and to the influence of the inferior potencies
the evils of the world must be attributed.
Again, borrowing the imagery of the Chaldeans,
Philo conceives of God as the pure and absolute
Light, the original source of effulgence, the
Logos or Word as the nearest circle of light
proceeding from it, and each separate power as
a separate ray, fading more and more away into
darkness, as it becomes removed from the
original source and centre. From this philosophy
was later developed that peculiar and
incomprehensible form of thought known as

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
Gnosticism. This Gnostic philosophy, which
reached its climax in the second century after
Christ, undertook to describe in detail all the
emanations from the original inconceivable deity;
Reason, the Word, practical Wisdom, theoretical
Wisdom, Power, Light, Life, were all lesser
deities. The God of the Jews was one of these
lower deities; Jesus Christ was a higher <span style="white-space:nowrap;">deity—the</span>
Reason according to some, the Word according
to others, who came to deliver the world
from its subjection to the inferior deity, and
who entered the body of Jesus at his baptism,
and departed from it just before his crucifixion.
Whether John was acquainted with the writings
of Philo we do not know; but he was certainly
familiar with this Gnostic philosophy. It had
already begun to enter into and corrupt the
Christian church during the lifetime of Paul,
whose writings contain frequent references to
different phases of it (<span class="muchsmaller">e. g.,
Col. 2:18; 1 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 4:1-4;
2 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 2:16-18</span>); Ephesus, a city of
 luxury, effeminacy
and superstition (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 19,
 notes</span>), was a
centre of this philosophy; in Paul’s address to
the elders of the church at Ephesus (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 20:29, 30</span>),
and in his letter to Timothy, first bishop of that
church (<span class="muchsmaller">subs. to 2 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr></span>),
he especially warns against
it (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 2:16-18; 3:8, 9</span>);
and Ephesus was John’s
residence, and probably the city in which he
wrote his Gospel. (See <a href="#Page_3">Introduction</a>.)</p>

<p>John, then, employs the language of this
mystical philosophy, in order more effectually
to refute its errors. He finds a certain substratum
of truth, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, that there is one God and one
Mediator between God and man, underlying
this superstructure of error; he begins his Gospel
by occupying this ground, and by his phraseology
brings himself into sympathy with his
Gnostic readers; then, from this common ground
he leads them on to the truth respecting the
incarnation. It is true, he says to them, that
there is a Word of God, but this Word was from
the beginning with God, and is indeed God himself,
who is not incommunicable, but a self-manifesting
God. It is true that there is a Life
and a Light; but the Life is God himself, not an
inferior and subordinate deity; and the Light is
not remote and unapproachable, but lighteth
every man that cometh into the world. For this
Mediator is not an emanation from God, but God
himself, the true Light shining in the darkness
(<span class="muchsmaller">verse <a href="#ch1_5">5</a></span>),
the true Life by whom we can not only
commune with Christ, but become the very
children of God (<span class="muchsmaller">verses
<a href="#ch1_12">12</a>, <a href="#ch1_13">13</a></span>). And he has come
and tabernacled among men in the flesh, in the
earthly life of Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

<p>It only remains to add that there is to be
found in the Old Testament (<span class="muchsmaller">see notes below</span>) a
Scriptural basis for John’s use of the language
here, particularly his phrase “the Word of
God,” and that there is not the least ground
for the claims of some rationalistic scholars that
John derived his doctrine here from Philo, or
from the Alexandrian or Gnostic schools. On
the contrary, his doctrine and theirs are radically
inconsistent. Philo holds that matter is inherently
defiling, that God cannot come into contact
with matter, even to fashion it in creation, without
defilement; John, that God “was made flesh
and dwelt among us,” and yet so far from being
defiled thereby, manifested his glory, “the glory
of the only-begotten of the Father.”</p>

<p><b>1. In the beginning.</b> John begins the
Gospel where Moses began the Law. The employment
of and the reference to the language
of the first verse of the first chapter of Genesis
is unmistakable. In that beginning in which
God created the heavens and the earth was the
Word, and the Word was with God and was God
and was the One through whom the act of creation
was consummated. So in <abbr title="Proverbs">Prov.</abbr>, <abbr title="chapter">chap.</abbr> 8,
Wisdom personified is represented as with God
in the creation and from the beginning (<span class="muchsmaller">see especially
verses 23-29</span>). For parallel passages teaching the
pre-existence of Christ, see John <a href="#ch8_58">8:58</a>;
<a href="#ch17_5">17:5</a>;
<abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:5, 6; 1 John 1:1.
In <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 3:14 he is
described as “the beginning of the creation of
God,” but this does not necessarily imply that
he was a created Being. See notes there.—&#8203;<b>Was
the Word.</b> There are several Greek words
meaning <dfn>word</dfn>; (1 and 2) <span lang="el">ῥῆμα</span> and <span lang="el">ἔπος</span>, word in
the grammatical sense, <i>i. e.</i>, that which is spoken;
(3) <span lang="el">μῦθος</span>, word in the rhetorical sense, that which
is delivered by words, the subject expressed;
(4) <span lang="el">ὄνομα</span>, word in a technical sense, strictly a
<dfn>name</dfn>, and only because words are names or appellations;
(5) <span lang="el">λόγος</span>, word in the philosophical sense,
the outward form by which the inward thought
is expressed. The latter term is employed here.
As the thoughts or experiences of the soul are
completely hidden from us till they are uttered,
so God is the Unknown and the Unknowable,
save as he utters himself, discloses his nature to
us, which he does chiefly if not solely through
him who is for that reason called the Word, <i>i. e.</i>,
the utterance of God. The metaphor which
underlies this phraseology is in part interpreted
by the saying of Wordsworth that language is
the incarnation of ideas. (2) In the Old Testament
we have a partial employment of the same
symbolism. In Moses’ account of the creation,
God is represented as calling the various powers
of nature into being by a <em>word</em>. “God said Light
be! Light was!” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr>
1:3, see also 6, 9, 11, etc.</span>) In
the later Hebrew poetry this symbol is made more
prominent in the distinct declaration that “by
the word of the Lord were the heavens made.”
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr>
33:6; <abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> 107:20; Isaiah 55:10, 11;
see also <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 11:3.</span>)
The same symbol, in a slightly different form, reappears
in <abbr title="Proverbs">Prov.</abbr>, <abbr title="chapter">chap.</abbr>
8, which is connected with
that employed here by the language of certain

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
of the apocryphal books, <i>e. g.</i>, “I (Wisdom)
came out of the mouth of the Most High and
covered the earth as a cloud” (<span class="muchsmaller">Ecclesiasticus 24:3</span>).
“She (Wisdom) is the breath of the power
of God” (<span class="muchsmaller">Wisdom of Solomon 1:25</span>).
(3) The same
symbolism was employed as we have seen
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Preliminary">Prel.</abbr>
Note <a href="#Page_13">above</a></span>) in the
mystical philosophy of Alexandria
and of later Gnosticism, with which John
was familiar, and of which, Ephesus, his city,
was a centre, to represent an eon or emanation
for the deity. That the Word here does not
mean the Bible or the Gospel is evident both
from the connection, since it cannot be said that
the Bible became flesh (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_14">14</a></span>), and also from
John’s usage, who never employs the phrase
Word of God to designate the Bible, but usually
the term Scriptures or writings (<span class="muchsmaller">John
<a href="#ch2_22">2:22</a>; <a href="#ch5_39">5:39</a>;
<a href="#ch7_38">7:38</a>, <a href="#ch7_42">42</a>;
<a href="#ch19_24">19:24</a>, <a href="#ch19_28">28</a>,
<a href="#ch19_36">36</a>, <a href="#ch19_37">37</a>, etc.</span>). Moreover he does
employ this phraseology elsewhere to designate
Jesus Christ (<span class="muchsmaller">1 John 1:1;
<abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 19:13</span>). It cannot
mean <dfn>the Speaking One</dfn> nor <dfn>the Promised One</dfn>.
Though both these meanings have been attributed
to it, it is not grammatically capable of
either interpretation. There is classical authority
for rendering it <dfn>Reason</dfn> or <dfn>Order</dfn>, and this
meaning it still retains in words ending with
<em>ology</em>, such as <em>ge-ology</em> (ge-logos), the order,
<i>i. e.</i>, science of the earth; <em>path-ology</em> (pathos-logos),
the order, <i>i. e.</i>, science of disease. But
it is never used with this signification by John,
and is never but once so used in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
(<span class="muchsmaller">1 Peter 3:15</span>), if even there the translation is
strictly accurate, which is doubtful. Seeking,
then, to understand John as he would have been
understood by his contemporaries, I think it
clear that he declares, not that Reason or Wisdom
was in the beginning with God, nor Speech,
nor the Promised Messiah, but <em>the Word</em>, <i>i. e.</i>,
<em>the One by and through whom he was chiefly to be
manifested to the world</em>, as one soul is to another
by utterance.—&#8203;<b>And the Word was with God
and the Word was God.</b> Grammatically the
last clause of the sentence may be read, <em>and God
was the Word</em>. But the obvious connection calls
for the rendering of our English version, and it
is the rendering adopted by the best scholars.
There is a difference in the language of the first
and last clause of this sentence in the original
which is significant, but difficult, if not impossible,
to render in the English. In the first
clause, “<cite>the Word was with God</cite>,” the article
accompanies the word God; in the second
clause, “<cite>the Word was God</cite>,” it is wanting. We
should measurably reflect the meaning by reading
the passage, “the Word was with God and
the Word was divine;” or “the Word was with
the Father and the Word was God.”</p>


<div class="p2 blockquote">

<p class="hanging">2 The same was in the beginning with God.</p>
</div>

<p><b>2. The same was in the beginning with
God.</b> John recurs to his first statement and
reiterates it, not merely for the sake of emphasis,
but also to mark a real distinction between
the Word and the unknown Father. For he
labors to express two conflicting and even
apparently contradictory ideas, the identity of
the Word with God and the individuality of the
Word, as distinct from the infinite and invisible
deity. This contradiction subsequent theology
has endeavored in vain to eliminate by drawing
distinctions between essence and substance, person
and being, etc., in such phraseologies as three
in substance and one in essence, or three persons
in one God. This <em>philosophy</em> of the Trinity is
extra-Scriptural, framed to harmonize teachings
respecting the divine nature, which are best
harmonized by the frank confession that the
knowledge of the divine nature is too wonderful
for us, we cannot attain unto it (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 139:6; Job
11:7</span>). So Chalmers, “The Father is God, the
Son is God, the Holy Spirit is God. God is one.
If you ask me to reconcile the four (propositions),
I answer, I cannot. We require no one to reconcile
the personality of each with the unity of
God.” So Calvin, “I could wish them (the
extra-Scriptural phrases, person, hypostasis,
etc.) to be buried in oblivion, provided this
truth were universally received, that the Father,
Son, and the Holy Spirit are the one God; and
that nevertheless the Son is not the Father,
nor the Spirit the Son, but that they are distinguished
from each other by some peculiar
properties.”</p>

<p><b>3. All things were made by him.</b> To
interpret this language “All things” as meaning
simply the moral creation, is to distort plain
language in order to conform it to preconceived
ideas, a fault in exegesis of which no school of
theology is entirely innocent. The reference to
Genesis, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 1, is unmistakable. The declaration
is parallel to and interpreted by such passages as
<abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 1:16; 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 8:6;
<abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 1:2. The Greek
student will observe, however, and the English
student should know, that the language here
implies that the Word was the <em>instrument</em> by
which God created the “all things,” not the
<em>original source of creative power</em>. There are two
Greek prepositions translated in English “<dfn>by</dfn>,”

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>one (<span lang="el">ἐκ</span>) signifying the source or origin from
which anything proceeds, or the power by which
it is produced; the other (<span lang="el">διά</span>) signifying the
means or instrument through which it is produced.
One indicates the original, the other the
proximate cause. The preposition here used is
the latter, and the exact meaning of the sentence
will be imparted by the rendering All
things were made <em>by means of him</em> or <em>through
him</em>. With this interpretation corresponds the
general teaching of the New Testament, which
represents Christ, both in his earthly life and
in his heavenly administration, as always the
executor of his Father’s will. This is in some
sense especially prominent in John’s Gospel (see
for example John <a href="#ch5_22">5:22</a>,<a href="#ch5_23"> 23</a>,
<a href="#ch5_27">27</a>; <a href="#ch6_37">6:37</a>,

<a href="#ch17_18">17:18</a>, <a href="#ch17_24">24</a>); but it is
equally clearly taught elsewhere (Luke 2:49;
1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 15:27, 28;
<abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:9;
<abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 1:19;
<abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
Mark 10:40, note and references there).—&#8203;<b>And
without him was not anything made
that was made.</b> Simply an emphatic and
exhaustive reiteration, such as is not infrequent
in fervid writing. For analogous rhetorical
repetition in John see verse <a href="#ch1_20">20</a>; 1 John 2:4, 27.
Some manuscripts and some few scholars put
a period at the close of the first clause of the
sentence, and connect the last clause with the
following verse, so that the passage reads: <cite>And
without him was not anything made. And what
originated in him was life.</cite> But while this reading
is grammatically possible, it is generally
repudiated by the best scholars, who accept the
punctuation and rendering of our English version
as correct.</p>

<p><b>4. In him was life.</b> There is probably a
reference here again to the language of Gnostic
philosophy (<span class="muchsmaller">See <abbr title="Preliminary">Prel.</abbr> <a href="#Page_13">Note</a></span>),
which supposed other
eons or emanations from God, besides the Word,
prominent among which was Light and Life.
Here, as throughout this introduction, John
employs the language of the Gnostics to correct
their errors. The general and practical teaching
for us of the declaration is that Christ is the
source of both physical or external life
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 1:17</span>),
and of intellectual and spiritual life
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch10_10">10:10</a></span>).
It is admirably interpreted by Kaulbach’s famous
cartoon of the Reformation, in which
Luther with the open Bible in his hand is represented
as the centre of the intellectual and
moral awakening which characterized that century.
Observe, since Christ is Life and Light,
that any religion which dwarfs man, represses
their life, belittles them, and any which shuts
them up in darkness and denies them intellectual
freedom and progress in any direction, is so
far anti-Christ. The cause of Christ has nothing
to fear from any intellectual life or any light of
scientific discovery.—&#8203;<b>And the life was the
light of men.</b> Not merely <em>shall be</em>, not merely
<em>is</em>, but <em>was</em>. The intimation is that all the light
of Old Testament prophecy and instruction, if
not all that dim religious light which has illuminated
even heathen nations, through special
instructors such as Buddha, Confucius and
Socrates, came through the Word, <i>i. e.</i>, through
the Mediator by whom the invisible God reveals
himself to man, of which revelation the incarnation
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_14">14</a></span>) is only a part, though a most important
part. Compare with the language here

<em>Shines</em>, not merely appears; a real illumination

not merely darkness; as, before God said
“Let there be light,” the earth is reported as enveloped
in darkness (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr>
1:2</span>), so, before and apart
from this spiritual illumination, through the
Light of the world, the nations of the earth were
in gross darkness. Comp. Isaiah 42:6, 7; <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
4:16, note; <abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 5:7, 8;
John <a href="#ch12_46">12:46</a>.—&#8203;<b>And
the darkness comprehended it not.</b> This
has been universally true in the world’s history;
the dim light of conscience has never been
apprehended, taken hold of by heathen nations.
The light afforded by special and signal moral
geniuses has never been comprehended aright
by the people, as witness the deterioration of
Buddhism and Confucianism; the teachings of
the Jewish prophets were not comprehended;
they shone in darkness which was not dispelled
by their instructors; and the clearer light of
Christ has never, even in the best ages, been
more than very imperfectly apprehended, even
in the church. Here the primary reference is
certainly to the constant closing of their eyes by
the Jews to the light of the Old Testament
teachings, concerning the spirit of true religion,
the nature of the kingdom of God, and the
character and appearance of the promised Messiah.

<p><b>6, 7. There was a man sent from God.</b>
From a characterization of the light, John passes
to a description of the incarnation and its object,
and to a discrimination between the incarnate
Light and the prophet who foretold its coming.
From the Greek word here rendered <dfn>sent</dfn> (<span lang="el">ἀποστέλλω</span>,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
<dfn>apostello</dfn>) comes our word <dfn>apostle</dfn>. The
apostle is a man sent from God; Christ is the
word or utterance, or manifestation of God.
<abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 1:1-3.—&#8203;<b>John.</b> The Baptist.—<b>The

John <a href="#ch5_32">5:32-35</a>.—&#8203;<b>To bear witness

He was not a mere preacher of the law,

phase of his ministry most prominent in the reports
of <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
(<span class="muchsmaller">3:1-12</span>), and Luke
(<span class="muchsmaller">3:1-18</span>). He
was a forerunner of the great King, sent to bear

ministry, though indicated in the other Gospels
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
3:11; 11:9, Mark 1:7, 8; Luke 3:16, 17</span>), is most

other construction, through the Light might believe,
<i>i. e.</i>, in God, is forced and unnatural, even
if grammatically admissible. The true office of
the Christian ministry is so to bear witness to the
Light which the preacher <em>knows</em> by his own experience
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr>

<p><b>8, 9.</b> An early Gnostic sect (second century)
believed that John was the Messiah. The primary
reference here appears to be to this error,
which, in common with other Gnostic errors
(<span class="muchsmaller">see
<abbr title="Preliminary">Prel.</abbr> <a href="#Page_13">Note</a></span>),
John aims to correct in this introduction
to his Gospel. Compare, with the declaration
here, Christ’s characterization of John, “He
was a burning and a shining light”
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch5_35">5:35</a></span>).
The Greek scholar will observe that the English
word “<dfn>light</dfn>” represents different Greek words in
the two passages. Here the word is one signifying
original light (<span lang="el">φῶς</span>), there rather a borrowed or
reflected light (<span lang="el">λύχνος</span>), though the latter word is
once applied to Christ (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 21:23</span>). We are to be
in a true sense the former kind of light (<span lang="el">φῶς</span>,
<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
5:14</span>), because Christ <em>in us</em> is our light, and
by his indwelling we are made partakers of his
nature (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 1:4</span>), and men seeing this light glorify,
not us, but Him who shines in and through
us.—<b>The true Light was that which lighteth
every man that cometh into the world.</b>
There is some difficulty about the construction
of this sentence; this appears to me to be the
best. For other constructions, see Alford and
Meyer. On the meaning of the declaration observe,
(1) That John’s use of the word <cite>true</cite> here
is interpreted by his use of the same word in
other and analogous passages, <i>e. g.</i>, “true worshippers”
(<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch4_23">4:23</a></span>);
“true bread” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch6_32">6:32</a></span>);
“true vine” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch15_1">15:1</a></span>). The light, the bread, the
vine of earth are regarded only as symbols of
the spiritual truths which they parabolically represent.
Christ is the original pattern, or source
of light; all prophets and teachers are only reflections
from him; all material light is a symbol
or parable of his illuminating grace. (2) The
phrase, “<cite>lighteth every man that cometh into the
world</cite>,” is not to be taken as an hyperbole. The
latter clause is added, not merely, as Meyer, “as
a solemn redundance,” “an epic fullness of
words,” but to emphasize and make clear the
declaration, and to show that “every man”
means not merely (<i>a</i>) the Jews, nor (<i>b</i>) those who
accept Christ as their light, nor (<i>c</i>) the Christian
nations, but literally <em>all men</em>. The <em>every</em> (<span lang="el">πᾶς</span>)
here is thus distinguished from the <em>all</em> (<span lang="el">πᾶς</span>) of
verse <a href="#ch1_7">7</a> above. Christ is the universal light; all
intellectual and political as well as moral illumination
has come through him; and this, not only
in Christendom, but also in heathendom. Such
light as struggles through the thick darkness, in
a partial disclosure of divine truth afforded by a
Buddha or a Confucius, or dimly recognized by a
Cornelius, comes from Him who, in larger or
smaller measure, lighteth <em>every</em> man that cometh
into the world. By this declaration we are to
interpret such passages as <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 8:11; Acts
10:35; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 5:9; whoever accepts even this
imperfect and dim light, mistakenly called the
light of Nature, in so far accepts Christ.</p>

<p><b>12. But as many as received him.</b> Not
merely, as Alford, “recognized him as that which
he <span style="white-space:nowrap;">was—the</span> Word of God and Light of men,”
but <em>received him</em> as the Word to be implicitly
obeyed (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_21">14:21</a>; <a href="#ch15_10">15:10</a>,
<a href="#ch15_15">15</a></span>), and the Light in which
to walk (<span class="muchsmaller">1 John 1:6</span>).—&#8203;<b>To them gave he power</b>
(<span lang="el">ἐξουσίαν</span>). Not <em>capability</em>, nor <em>privilege</em>, nor <em>claim</em>,
but <em>power and right</em>; the original word combines
the two ideas. He confers the <em>power</em> to become
the sons of God, and confers the <em>right</em> to claim
that privilege. Ryle is certainly correct in saying
that this verse “does not mean that Christ
confers on those who receive him a spiritual and
moral strength, by which they convert themselves,
change their own hearts, and make themselves
God’s children.” He is as certainly wrong
in saying, with Calvin and the marginal reading,
that the original Greek word means “right or
privilege.” The reader will best get its meaning
by comparing John’s use of it in other passages,
in no one of which could it be rendered either
“right” or “privilege.” See <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch5_27">5:27</a>; <a href="#ch10_18">10:18</a>;

<a href="#ch19_11">11</a>. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 28:18, note.
The plain implication here is that the <em>power</em> to
become a son of God is not natural and inherent,
but acquired, and is the especial gift of God.
See <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:12, 13;
Titus 3:4, 5.—&#8203;<b>To become
the sons of God.</b> Sons and therefore (1) partakers
of the divine nature (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 4:13;
<abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 12:10;
2 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 1:4</span>);
(2) entitled to and walking in freedom
as children, not in bondage as servants
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch15_15">15:15</a>;
<abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 4:1-7</span>); (3) heirs of God and joint-heirs with
Christ, his only-begotten Son (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:16, 17</span>). But
the full conception of the meaning of this sonship
we cannot know, till in the other world we see
the Father as he is (<span class="muchsmaller">1 John 3:1, 2</span>).—&#8203;<b>Even to them
that have faith in his name.</b> His name is
<dfn>Jesus</dfn>, <i>i. e.</i>, Saviour, given to him because he
saves his people from their sins (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 1:21</span>). To
have faith in that name is to have faith in him as
a personal Saviour from sin. Observe, then, that
this verse comprises the whole Gospel in a sentence.
It declares (1) the object of the Gospel:
that we who are by nature the children of disobedience
and of wrath (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 2:2, 3</span>) may become
the sons of God; (2) the source to which we are
to look for this prerogative of sonship: <em>power</em>
conferred by God; (3) the means by which we
are to attain it: personal faith in a personal
Saviour from sin. Observe too that John follows
his description of the rejection of Christ,
not by threatening punishment to them, but by
depicting the infinite gain of those that accept
Christ.</p>

3:6, 7</span>); but by the direct personal influence and
contact of the Spirit of God on the heart (<span class="muchsmaller">Titus

of the preceding verse, that <em>God gives the power to
become the sons of God</em>, by declaring that Christian
character is not the product of either good
parentage, a strong will, or a good education, but
directly of a divine recreative act. (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 6:15.</span>)
The Greek student will observe that the preposition
used is <em>of</em> (<span lang="el">ἐκ</span>), not <em>through</em> (<span lang="el">διά</span>); the writer
is speaking of the <em>origin</em> or <em>source</em> of Christian
character, not of the <em>instruments</em> by which it is
developed. Good parentage, will power, and
education, are all <em>means</em> for the development
of divine sonship; the original cause, without
which a true son of God is never produced, is the
creative act of God himself.</p>

<p><b>14. And the Word.</b> The self-manifesting
God, as described in the first verse.—&#8203;<b>Became
flesh.</b> Not <em>a man</em> (<span lang="el">ἄνθρωπος</span>) nor <em>a body</em> (<span lang="el">σῶμα</span>),
but <em>flesh</em> (<span lang="el">σάρξ</span>). The word is one whose signification
would probably be best rendered to the
English reader by the phrase <cite>human nature</cite>.
Though occasionally used in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> of the literal
and material flesh (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 2:31</span>), it almost always
indicates man in his corporeal or earthly nature,
sometimes signifying the predominance of that
over the higher or spiritual nature, sometimes
simply signifying this aspect of his nature, without
any indication of its corrupt tendencies.
Here, then, the declaration is that the Word became
human nature; <em>how</em> is not indicated. The
language gives no sanction to either of the two
principal theories of the incarnation; the first,
that Christ <em>took on</em> human nature as something
superadded to the divine, so carrying through
life a double nature, both divine and human; the
second, that he simply entered a human body
and became subject to the limitations which it
imposed on him. <em>How the divine became human</em>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
we must learn elsewhere in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>, if the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
reveals it at all; but the declaration here is explicit
that the divine Word became human.—&#8203;<b>And
tabernacled among us.</b> <em>Pitched his tent
with us.</em> As God in the wilderness dwelt for a
time in the transitory tabernacle, so the Word
dwelt in the flesh, which is elsewhere in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
compared to a tabernacle (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 5:1, 4; 2 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 1:13, 14</span>).
As God dwelt subsequently in the permanent
Temple at Jerusalem, so the Word makes its permanent
abode in the soul of the believer, which
is the <em>Temple</em>, not the Tabernacle of God
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch15_6">15:6</a>,
<a href="#ch15_7">7</a>; 2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 6:16;
<abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 21:3</span>).
That the reference here
is to the incarnation, not to the spiritual presence
of Christ with the believer, is evident from the
fact that the verb (<span lang="el">ἐσκίνωσεν</span>) is in the historical
tense. John says he <em>tabernacled</em>, not he <em>tabernacles</em>,
among us.—&#8203;<b>And we beheld his glory,
the glory as of the only begotten from the
Father.</b> We are made sons of God; but Christ
alone is the <em>only begotten Son</em>. For the meaning
of this phrase, see Luke 7:12; 8:42; 9:38.
John uses it only of Jesus Christ. The Greek
student should observe the use of the preposition
<em>from</em> (<span lang="el">παρά</span>). It designates the source from
which anything is derived, and here indicates
that in a peculiar sense Christ is from the Father,
directly and immediately; we are from him only
through Christ. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch7_29">7:29</a>.
In a peculiar
sense the Apostles beheld Christ’s glory
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch2_11">2:11</a>;
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 17:1-4; 2 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 1:16; 1 John 1:1</span>). But in Christ’s
life and character, and in their influence on the
world, we are all beholders of the true divine
glory, manifested in him (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 1:3</span>); and his earthly
life is the brightness and glory of heaven (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr>
21:23; 5:9, 10</span>). The language, <cite>as of the only begotten</cite>,
distinguishes the glory of Christ from
that of all previous revealers of the divine will
and nature. Since many of the prophets too
were glorified, as Moses, Elijah, and Elisha, the
one encircled by the fiery chariot, the other taken
up by it; and after them Daniel and the three
children, and the many others who showed forth
wonders; and angels who have appeared among
men, and partly disclosed to beholders the flashing
light of their proper nature; and since not
angels only, but even the cherubim were seen by
the prophet in great glory and the seraphim
also; the Evangelist, leading us away from all
these, and removing our thoughts from created
things, and from the brightness of our fellow-servants,
sets us at the very summit of good.
For, “not of prophets,” says he, “nor angel, nor
archangel, nor of the higher powers, nor of any
other created nature, if other there be, but of the
Master himself, the King himself, the true only
begotten Son himself, of the very Lord of all, did
we <em>behold the glory</em>.”—(<cite>Chrysostom.</cite>)—&#8203;<b>Full of
grace and truth.</b> There is some doubt whether
this is said of the <em>glory</em> beheld, or of the <em>only
begotten Son</em> whose glory was beheld. The question
is not very important; the latter construction
is grammatically preferable. Thus rendered, the
clause “And we beheld, etc.,” is parenthetical,
John’s statement being: “The Word tabernacled
among us, full of grace and truth.” Observe
(1) that the <em>grace</em> here answers to the <em>Life</em> in
verse <a href="#ch1_4">4</a>, and the <em>truth</em>
to the <em>Light</em> in verse <a href="#ch1_9">9</a>.
Because of his grace Christ is Life to all who accept
him; because of his truth he is Light to all
who follow him; (2) that the declaration here is
explained by, and is possibly partially derived
from Exodus 33:18, 19, where Moses asks to see
God’s glory, and is promised a disclosure of the
divine <em>goodness</em>; in the goodness of God in Christ
Jesus we behold the divine glory; (3) that the
Christian is to be, like his Master, full of grace
<em>and</em> truth, and that to be at once perfectly truthful
and also gracious is one of the most difficult
practical problems of the Christian life (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 12:9</span>).
It seems to me clear that John has in mind
throughout this verse the manifestation of the
glory of God, through the Shechinah, in the Tabernacle,
and subsequently in the Temple (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> 40:34,
35; 1 Kings 8:10; see <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 17:5, note</span>). As the Shechinah
made luminous and glorious these earthly
dwelling-places, so the Word, by his indwelling,
made glorious the flesh.</p>

<p><b>15. John is testifying concerning him.</b>
John the Baptist was long since dead when these
words were written; but his testimony was not
dead; it was an ever-living testimony. The verb
is therefore put in the present tense, not, as in
our English version, in the past.—&#8203;<b>And he
cried, saying,</b> It is the echo of this cry which
still resounds and witnesses to Jesus Christ. The
language used implies a public testimony, and
one borne with confidence and joy. On seeing the
Christ of whom he had prophesied, John the Baptist
<em>cries out</em>, “This is he of whom I spoke.” For
illustration of John’s prophetic utterances concerning
the Messiah, previous to the baptism of
Jesus, see <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 3:11, 12; Mark 1:7, 8.—&#8203;<b>He
that cometh after me.</b> Christ did not begin
his public ministry till the imprisonment of John
the Baptist (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 1:14</span>). Thus as a public teacher
he came after John the Baptist.—&#8203;<b>Came forth
before me.</b> Not, <em>was before me</em> (<span lang="el">γίγνομαι</span> has not
the force of <span lang="el">εἰμί</span>), for then the sentence would be
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">tautological—that</span> Jesus <em>was</em> before John is in the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
next clause given as the <em>reason</em> for the statement
in this, that he came forth before him; nor can
the meaning be <em>was preferred before me</em>, in the
sense of esteemed above me, for the mere fact of
Christ’s pre-existence would be no reason for
esteeming him more highly than <span style="white-space:nowrap;">John—the</span> devil
<em>existed</em> before John the Baptist; nor, <em>was preferred
before me</em>, in the sense of, was exalted in rank
above me, though some excellent scholars, <i>e. g.</i>,
Alford, Olshausen, De Wette, so interpret it;
but, as I have rendered it above, <em>came forth</em>, or,
<em>was set before me</em>. The reference is to the previous
manifestations of the Word, in the partial revelations
of God in the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>
All the disclosures
of the divine nature in the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>
were made
through the Word or utterance of God, through
whom alone he speaks to the human race. See
<abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch1_4">4</a>, note, and
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_56">8:56-58</a>.
John then says
“He who is coming after me is the One who has
already come forth before me; for he existed
before me.” Christ’s pre-existence would not explain
the preference, either in the divine love or
in rank, but it does in part explain precedence in
appearance or manifestation. So Hengstenberg,
“My successor is my predecessor.”</p>

<p><b>16. And of his fullness have we all received.</b>
The <em>fullness</em> is that of the divine nature,
of which we are made partakers through faith in
Christ (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr>
1:19; 2:9, 10; <abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 3:19</span>). The <em>all</em> are
those who receive him and thus become the sons
of God (<span class="muchsmaller">verse <a href="#ch1_12">12</a></span>).
This and the two following
verses are the addition of the Evangelist, not the
continuance of John the Baptist’s discourse; this
is evident both from their style, which better
accords with that of the Evangelist, and because
the <em>fullness</em> of Christ’s nature was not received
by John the Baptist and his disciples, for it was
not disclosed till after the Baptist’s death. Observe,
(1) How inexhaustible the fountain. From
Christ’s fullness all spiritual life is supplied.
Chrysostom compares Christ to a fire from which
ten thousand lamps are kindled, but which burns
as brightly thereafter as before. “The sea is
diminished if you take a drop from it, though
the diminution be imperceptible; but how much
soever a man draw from the divine Fountain, it
continues undiminished.” (2) How free the supply;
we have <em>all</em> received. “None went empty
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">away.”—(<cite>Meyer.</cite>)</span> (3) The nature of Christian
experience. It is not a mere trust in a crucified
Saviour for pardon for the past; it is also a personal
and continuous receiving of divine life from
the fullness of a living Saviour.—&#8203;<b>And grace for
grace.</b> Of this expression there are two interpretations.
The ancient expositors understood
it to mean, For the lesser grace of the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> we
have received the greater grace of the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
So Chrysostom: “There was a righteousness
and there is a righteousness (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 1:17</span>); there
was a glory and there is a glory (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 3:11</span>);
there was a law and there is a law (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:2</span>);
there was a service and there is a service (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr>
9:4; 12:11</span>); there was a covenant and there is a
covenant (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Jeremiah">Jer.</abbr> 31:31, 32</span>); there was a sanctification
and there is a sanctification; there was a baptism
and there is a baptism; there was a sacrifice and
there is a sacrifice; there was a temple and there
is a temple; there was a circumcision and there is
a circumcision; and so too there was a grace and
there is a grace.” The modern commentators,
Alford, Meyer, Lange, etc., understand it to mean,
“For each new accessory of grace we receive a
still larger gift. Each grace, though, when given
large enough, is, as it were, overwhelmed by the
accumulation and fullness of that which <span style="white-space:nowrap;">follows.”—(<cite>Bengel.</cite>)</span>
“Grace for grace, grace <em>in the place</em>
of that which <span style="white-space:nowrap;">preceded—therefore</span> grace uninterrupted,
unceasingly <span style="white-space:nowrap;">renewed.”—(<cite>Winer.</cite>)</span> The
spiritual signification of the passage is substantially
the same on either interpretation. We have
nothing to give in exchange for the divine grace;
our only virtue is to receive. It is given to us in
exchange for the grace already imparted. “Unto
every one that hath shall be given;” but what
he already hath is God’s gift, which bestows
both the good and the purchase money, each
new gift superseding the old, as the
<abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> gift of
grace and truth through Jesus Christ superseded
the lesser gift of law through Moses. With this
accords the teaching of both <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>
and <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
See, for example, <abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> 7:7;
<abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 6:4; 23:3;
25:7; 31:16; 79:9; 115:1; Isaiah 55:1;

<p><span class="smcap">On the meaning of the word “grace.”</span> The
word here translated <dfn>grace</dfn> (<span lang="el">χάρις</span>) is also variously
translated in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
<dfn>acceptable</dfn>, <dfn>benefit</dfn>, <dfn>favor</dfn>,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
<dfn>gift</dfn>, <dfn>joy</dfn>, <dfn>liberality</dfn>,
<dfn>pleasure</dfn>, <dfn>thanks</dfn>, and <dfn>thankworthy</dfn>.
This fact will of itself sufficiently indicate
that the word possesses various shades of
meaning. They are all, however, etymologically
derived from the same root idea. The noun is
derived from a verb meaning to rejoice, and primarily
signifies that which gives joy to another.
With the Greeks, beauty was one of the chief
joys; hence the first meaning of the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">word—grace</span>
of external form, manner, or language, a meaning
which it but rarely bears in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> (<span class="muchsmaller">see Luke
4:22; <abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 4:6</span>). Thence it derived a deeper meaning,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, beauty in character, and this, according
to the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> teaching, is good-will, the disposition
to do a kindness to another, to make another
rejoice; hence the word is used to signify that
quality in God which leads him to confer freely
happiness on men, either on special individuals
(<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 2:40; 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 3:10</span>), or on the whole human race
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 3:24; <abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 1:6; <abbr title="Titus">Tit.</abbr> 2:11</span>). Thence it was employed
to designate the kindness actually flowing
from and conferred by this disposition, hence an
alms, and in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> the spiritual gifts conferred
by the divine love on the soul (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 16:3;
2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 8:4; 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 15:10; 2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 6:1; 2 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 3:18</span>); in which
sense it is employed in the apostolic benediction
(<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 1:3; 2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 1:2; <abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 1:3, etc.</span>). Finally it was
used to designate the feeling awakened by favors
shown, the reflection in the human heart of the
divine grace imparted, and hence gratitude and
even its expression in thanks (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 6:32-34; 17:9;
1 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 1:12; 2 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 1:3</span>). Underlying its meaning in
all these uses is the radical idea that the gift is
conferred freely and finds its only motive in the
bounty and love of the giver, an idea which finds
expression in the Latin word <dfn>gratis</dfn> (for nothing),
now thoroughly Anglicized, a word which comes
from the same root as grace (<dfn>gratia</dfn>). By the
doctrine of grace, then, as it is variously expounded
in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>, is meant that our own spiritual
life is the free gift of God, bestowed on us without
merit or desert on our part, purely from the
love and good-will of God. Our <em>graces</em> are God’s
<em>free gifts</em>. John here marks the contrast between
the law which <em>requires</em> obedience of man, and
grace and truth which <em>confers</em> spiritual power on
man. The one says, Do this and live; the other
says, Live, so that you can do this (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:3</span>).
Nowhere in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> is the doctrine of grace
more clearly set forth than in these 16th and 17th
verses, which may be paraphrased thus: From
the divine fullness in Jesus Christ we have all
received; the only condition which God attaches
to the free impartation of his spiritual gifts is
that we should have received willingly those
already proffered to us; by Moses it was revealed
to us what God would have us do and be; by
Christ it is clearly disclosed to us what God is,
and there is freely imparted to us power to become,
like him, sons of God.</p>

Not merely <em>no man</em>; no <span style="white-space:nowrap;"><em>one</em>—man,</span> angel, archangel.
The phrase here, <cite>seen God</cite>, is equivalent
to the phrase <cite>knowing God perfectly</cite>, in
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
11:27 (<span class="muchsmaller">see note there</span>). We know him but in part,

Christ sees him because he is one with

reading is adopted by Tregelles, but rejected by
Alford, Meyer, and Tischendorf. For examination
of the authorities on both sides, see Alford
(sixth edition) and Lange, critical note by Dr.
Schaff. The external authorities are not conclusive;
internal authority strongly favors the ordinary
reading. The only begotten God is a phrase
occurring nowhere else in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>, and is unnatural
if not unmeaning. The change of a single
letter in the early copies would account for
the corruption of the text (<span lang="el">Ψ</span> to <span lang="el">Θ</span>).—&#8203;<b>Which
is in the bosom of the Father.</b> A metaphorical
expression, indicating the closeness of intimacy,
and drawn more probably from the relation
of a child with its parents, than from the not infrequent
reclining of one on the bosom of his
friend, at meal-time (<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch13_25">13:25</a></span>).—&#8203;<b>He

These and other kindred
passages indicate clearly <em>how</em> Christ declares
the Father, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, not merely by what he teaches
concerning the divine nature, but yet more by his
personal manifestation of the divine nature in his
own life and character. This verse thus interprets
the word <cite>truth</cite> in the preceding verse, as
the word grace has already been interpreted by
verses <a href="#ch1_11">11</a> and <a href="#ch1_12">12</a>.
Christ is the <em>truth</em> of God,
because he reveals the divine nature; he is the
<em>grace</em> of God because he imparts the divine nature
to such as trust in him.</p>

<p><a id="TOC21"></a><span class="smcap">Note on the Incarnation.</span> A correct apprehension
of the character and place in history of
Jesus Christ is essential to a correct apprehension
of Christianity. Our conception of the system
will depend upon our conception of the Founder.
The other Evangelists give simply the story of
his life, leaving the readers to draw their own
deductions respecting him. John, writing at a
later date, and in a more philosophical atmosphere,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
begins his Gospel with a characterization
of the One the story of whose earthly life he is
about to narrate. It is evident on even a cursory
examination of this preface that John believed
and intended to teach, (1) That Christ existed
prior to his earthly birth. He was the Light that
lighteth every man that cometh into the world;
was before John the Baptist, whom in his earthly
history and mission he succeeded; and he was
in the beginning with God
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verses">vers.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_1">1</a>, <a href="#ch1_4">4</a>, <a href="#ch1_15">15</a></span>). (2) That
he possessed a superhuman character. He is
carefully distinguished from and placed above
John the Baptist, the last of the prophets and
more than a prophet (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
11:9</span>), and from Moses
the lawgiver and politically the founder of the
Jewish nation; and he is emphatically declared
not only to have been with God in the beginning,
but to have partaken of the divine nature
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verses">vers.</abbr> <a href="#ch1_1">1</a>,
<a href="#ch1_6">6-8</a>, <a href="#ch1_17">17</a></span>).
(3) This superhuman character is further
illustrated by what is declared of his office or
work. He is the Creator, the Light and Life of
men, the regenerating power through whom men
are brought into divine sonship, the daily support
of the spiritual life of the children of God, the
disclosure of the divine nature to men
 (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verses">vers.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_3">3</a>, <a href="#ch1_4">4</a>, <a href="#ch1_12">12</a>,
<a href="#ch1_13">13</a>, <a href="#ch1_16">16</a>, <a href="#ch1_18">18</a></span>).
(4) This truth is incidentally, but all
the more effectively, enforced by John’s peculiar
language in describing Christ’s earthly state: he
“tabernacled among us and we beheld his glory,
the glory as of the only begotten from the Father”
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_14">14</a></span>). (5) Finally, it is illustrated in the various
titles conferred upon him throughout this chapter,
which are ten in number: the Word; the
Light; the Life; the only begotten of the Father;
Jesus Christ, <i>i. e.</i>, the Saviour, the Messiah; the
only begotten Son; the Lamb of God; the Son of
God; Master; the Son of Man. It is not the
province of the commentator to construct a systematic
theology. But it is certain that these
elements must enter into any conception of Jesus
Christ which is founded on and accords with the
<abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> There is probably no other single passage
of equal length in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> which contains so
much respecting the character and office of Jesus
Christ as this preface to John’s Gospel; with it,
however, should be examined Paul’s Christology
(<span class="muchsmaller">e. g., <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr>
2:5-11</span>), and that of the unknown author
of the Epistle to the Hebrews (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr>, <abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr> 1, 2</span>).</p>

<p>The historical portion of the Fourth Gospel
begins here. The interview between the deputation
from the Sanhedrim and John the Baptist
here described probably took place after the
baptism of Jesus, and during the temptation, of
which latter event this Gospel makes no mention.
With the account of the Baptist’s ministry given

<p><b>19, 20. And this is the witness of John.</b>
The writer goes back and gives a detailed history
of John’s first explicit testimony to the Messiah,
connecting it with his previous reference to that
testimony in verse <a href="#ch1_15">15</a>.—&#8203;<b>When the Jews sent
priests and Levites.</b> In John’s Gospel, the
term Jews generally signifies, not the residents of
Palestine, but those of Judea, and sometimes the
official heads of the people. This appears to be
the meaning here. It is clear from verse <a href="#ch1_22">22</a> that
this was an official deputation, probably sent by
the Sanhedrim. The Baptist’s preaching had
produced a profound sensation throughout that
part of Palestine; great crowds flocked to his
ministry; he was universally regarded as a
prophet, and by some as perhaps the Messiah;
some of the Pharisees themselves came to his
baptism, though his severe denunciation of their
formalism, and their own opposition to such a
personal reform as his preaching demanded, made
them, as a class, bitterly opposed to him (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 3:5,
7; 21:25, 26; Luke 3:15</span>). It was therefore natural
and fit that the Sanhedrim should send to inquire
officially respecting his ministry. There is nothing
to indicate whether this inquiry was conducted
in a hostile spirit or otherwise.—&#8203;<b>Who art
thou?</b> Observe, throughout this interview, the
difference in the spirit of the inquirers and of
John. They persist in demanding to know <em>who</em>
he is; he replies only by pointing out <em>what</em> he
does. “They ever ask about his <em>person</em>; he ever
refers them to his <em>office</em>. He is no <span style="white-space:nowrap;">one—a</span> <em>voice</em>
merely; it is the work of God, the testimony to
Christ, which is everything. So the formalist
ever in the church asks, <em>Who</em> is he? while the
witness for Christ only exalts, only cares for
Christ’s <span style="white-space:nowrap;">work.”—(<cite>Alford.</cite>)</span>—<b>And he publicly
acknowledged, and denied not.</b> We know
from Luke 3:15 that some thought he <em>might</em> be
the Messiah; and later, a Gnostic sect maintained
that he was the Messiah. This testimony, amplifying
the brief reference to it in verses <a href="#ch1_7">7</a>,
<a href="#ch1_8">8</a>, is
probably inserted in part to refute this error.</p>


<div class="p2 blockquote">

<p><b>21. Art thou Elijah? And he saith, I
am not.</b> <abbr title="Malachi">Mal.</abbr> 4:5 declares that Elijah should

and even his appearance (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 3:4 with
2 Kings 1:8</span>), resembled that of Elijah. Christ distinctly
declares that John the Baptist is the Elijah
foretold by the prophet and expected by the
people (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 17:12, 13;
<abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> Luke 1:17</span>). Here John
says he is not. The true explanation is, not that

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
the people were expecting a literal resurrection
of Elijah from the dead, and John denied that he
fulfilled that expectation, but that, like many
another great but humble messenger of God, he
did not comprehend his own character and mission
and relation to ancient prophecy. He was
more than he knew.—&#8203;<b>Art thou that prophet?</b>
From <abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr>, 8:15
the Jews expected a prophet
to precede the Messiah
(<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch6_14">6:14</a>;
<a href="#ch7_40">7:40</a></span>). Not till

<p><b>24-27. And they which were sent were
of the Pharisees.</b> The Pharisees were scrupulous
ceremonialists, and ablutions were an important
part of their ceremonial. See <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 15:1-7;
Mark 7:2-5, notes. To them John’s employment
of baptism appeared irregular and unauthorized
if he were not invested with some special
divine authority.—&#8203;<b>John answered them.</b> This
answer is only indirectly responsive to their interrogatory.
He passes at once from his own
authority, which he disdains to defend, to testify
to the Messiah, whose forerunner he is. The
synoptical Evangelists (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 3:11, 12, note; Mark 1:7, 8;
Luke 3:16, 17</span>) report more fully John’s characterization
of his own baptism and its contrast with
that which the Messiah would inaugurate; one
in water, the other in fire and the Holy Ghost;
one a symbol, the other the thing symbolized;
one a prophecy, the other its fulfillment.—&#8203;<b>There
standeth one among you whom ye know
not.</b> That is, do not recognize as what he really
is, the Messiah. It is not necessarily implied
that Jesus Christ was present at this interview,
and verse <a href="#ch1_29">29</a> implies that he was not. The language
simply points to one apparently of the
common people and unknown.—&#8203;<b>Who cometh
after me, whose shoe-latchet I am unworthy
to unloose.</b> This is the true reading; the
words <cite>is preferred before me</cite> have been added by
some copyist from verse <a href="#ch1_15">15</a>. On the significance
of the expression, see notes on <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 3:11 and
Luke 3:16. The latchet of the shoe is the leather
thong with which the sandal was bound on to

it has been fixed by Origen as far south

near Succoth; by Lightfoot, north of the Sea of

at one of the fords of the Jordan, in the great

between the sea of Galilee and the neighborhood

so rendered by some commentators here, in order

Why he was coming toward him is not a matter

for baptism, for the temptation followed the
baptism, and the order of events in John’s narrative

meaning cannot therefore be, Behold a pure and
innocent man; an interpretation which would
probably never have been conceived, but for the
purpose of escaping the doctrine of atonement
for sin, which can be escaped only by rejecting
both the Old and the New Testaments in their

<em>that taketh away</em> thy goods; John <a href="#ch11_39">11:39</a>, <em>take
away</em> the stone; <a href="#ch11_48">11:48</a>, the Romans shall <em>take
away</em> both our place, etc. It thus corresponds
almost exactly with the word (<span lang="el">ἁφίηγι</span>) ordinarily
translated forgive. See <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 6:12, note. Observe
that the verb is in the present tense, <em>is
taking away</em>. The sacrifice has been offered
once for all; but its effect is a continuous one.
Christ is ever engaged in lifting up and taking
away the sin of the world.—&#8203;<b>The sin of the
world.</b> Not <em>sins from the world</em>, which would
be a very different matter. The sin is represented
as <em>one burden</em>, which Christ <em>as a whole</em> lifts up and
carries away. His redemption is not a limited
redemption; it provides a finished salvation for
the entire human race. See
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch16_22">16:22</a>, note.</p>

<p>Very unnecessary difficulty has been made
respecting the interpretation of the Baptist’s
simple metaphor here. The lamb was throughout
the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> times commonly used for sacrifice
as a sin-offering (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Leviticus">Lev.</abbr> 4:32</span>);
in cleansing the leper
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Leviticus">Lev.</abbr> 14:10</span>);
at the morning and evening sacrifice
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> 29:38</span>);
at all the great feasts (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Numbers">Numb.</abbr> 28:11;
29:2, 13, 37; <abbr title="Leviticus">Lev.</abbr> 23:19</span>); and in large numbers on
special occasions (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Chronicles">Chron.</abbr> 29:21;
2 <abbr title="Chronicles">Chron.</abbr> 29:32; 35:7</span>).
The sacrifice of the paschal lamb at the Passover
connected the lamb as a sacrifice with the greatest
feast day of the nation, and with the national
redemption from bondage and deliverance from
death (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> 12:21-27</span>).
The ceremony with the
scape-goat on the day of atonement, the only
fast-day in the Jewish calendar, interpreted
clearly, and by an annual symbol, the meaning
of these sacrifices. On that day two kids of
goats were chosen, closely resembling each
other; one was slain as a sin-offering; over the
other the high-priest confessed the sins of the
people, “putting them on the head of the goat,”
who was then led away into the wilderness, “to
bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not
inhabited” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Leviticus">Lev.</abbr>
16:5-10, 20-22</span>). Isaiah, with unmistakable
reference to these typical sacrifices,
declared that the Messiah should bear the sins
and sorrows of the world as a lamb slaughtered
(<span class="muchsmaller">Isaiah 53:1-7</span>);
and the Baptist, speaking to a
people whose national education had led them
to regard the lamb as the type of sacrifice,
through the shedding of whose blood there was
a redemption, a carrying away of sins, points to
Jesus with the declaration, Behold <em>the</em> Lamb
of God that taketh away the sin of the world,
that is, the true Sin-bearer, of whom all that
went before were but types and prophecies.
<em>How</em> he was to take away this load of sin the
Baptist does not say, and probably did not
know. That he did not realize that Christ was
to be a true sacrifice for sin is indicated by his
subsequent perplexity and message to Jesus
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 11:2-6, note</span>).
 Observe the analogy and the
contrast between the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> and the
<abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> Under
the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> there were provided by the sinner
lambs, whose sacrifice took sin away from the
individual or the nation, but for the time only,
and therefore the sacrifice needed to be continually
repeated; under the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> <em>one</em> Lamb is
provided, the Lamb of God, <i>i. e.</i>, proceeding
from and <em>provided by God</em>, as intimated by
Abraham to Isaac (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 22:8</span>),
whose sacrifice
<em>once for all</em> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 10:10-12</span>)
takes away the sin of
the <em>whole world</em> (<span class="muchsmaller">1 John 2:2</span>), and therefore never
needs to be repeated. It is worthy of note that
the word <cite>lamb</cite> is never used in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> except
in reference to Jesus Christ (<span class="muchsmaller">John
<a href="#ch1_29">1:29</a>, <a href="#ch1_36">36</a>; Acts
8:32; 1 Peter 1:19; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 5:6, 8, 12, etc.</span>). The word
<cite>lambs</cite> in the plural form occurs twice, but both
times refer to the disciples of Christ (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 10:3;
John <a href="#ch21_15">21:15</a></span>).</p>

<p><b>32-34. And John witnessed.</b> Evidently
the Evangelist here speaks of his witness at
some period subsequent to the baptism, and
therefore subsequent to the temptation which
immediately succeeded the baptism.—&#8203;<b>I saw
the Spirit descending from heaven like
a dove.</b> That is, in the form of a dove. The
vision was seen only by Jesus and John. On it

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
see <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 3:16, note.—&#8203;<b>And it abode upon
him.</b> The Spirit of God, not the dove, abode.
That John in some way recognized the abiding
as a part of the sign of Christ’s Messiahship, is
evident from the next verse; how he recognized
it is not indicated.—&#8203;<b>I also knew him not.</b>
He connects himself with the people who knew
him not (<span class="muchsmaller">verse <a href="#ch1_26">26</a></span>). <b>I</b>, as well as you, knew him
not, till this sign was vouchsafed me. Why
then did he at first object to baptizing Jesus, if he
did not recognize in him the Christ (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 3:14</span>).
He was second cousin of Jesus; knew him,
probably, as a pure and holy man; perhaps knew
the facts respecting Jesus’ birth, which were
certainly known to John’s mother; may even
have <em>suspected</em> that he was the promised Messiah;
and at all events may have believed that
he needed no baptism of repentance. He did
not, however, know him to be the Messiah, and
did not recognize him <em>as such</em>, till after the
promised sign, and this followed the baptism of
Jesus.—&#8203;<b>Saw and bare witness.</b> That is, at
that time. He refers the people to his witness-bearing
at the time of the baptism, a testimony
which was still fresh in their memory.</p>

day following the apparent public discourse, so
briefly reported in the preceding verses
(<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch1_29">29-34</a></span>).—&#8203;<b>And
two of his disciples.</b> See on their
names verse <a href="#ch1_40">40</a> and note. As they were disciples
of the Baptist it is to be presumed that
they had been baptized, but by John’s baptism
which was unto repentance and not in the name
of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. See Acts
19:3-5.—&#8203;<b>As he walked.</b> Or, as we should
say, <cite>As he was taking a walk</cite>. One of the numerous
indications in the Gospels that Christ was a
lover of nature, and accustomed to meditate and
study in communion with nature.—&#8203;<b>Saith, Behold
the Lamb of God.</b> See on verse <a href="#ch1_29">29</a>.
Observe the practical value of line upon line.
John’s private message recalls and repeats his
public testimony. See <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr>
3:1.—&#8203;<b>And the
two disciples heard him speak.</b> He spoke
possibly in soliloquy, more probably to them.
It is clear that it was not a public discourse
which is here reported. There is no ground for
the hypothesis that the two disciples had not
heard the discourse of the previous day. Rather
the implication is that they had heard it, and
these words uttered to them in private by their
teacher, enforced the public lesson, and led
them to seek further knowledge concerning the
one who was pointed out to them as the Messiah.
Observe how this passage teaches the
value of personal work and personal influence.
The first disciples are led to seek Christ, not by
the public discourse, but by the private words
of the Baptist; by private influence they bring
Peter (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch1_41">41</a></span>); by private invitation Philip is added
to the disciples (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch1_43">43</a></span>); and by his personal solicitation
Nathanael is brought to Christ (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch1_45">45</a></span>).—&#8203;<b>And
they followed Jesus.</b> Not, in the religious
sense of the words, became followers of Jesus;
not till later did they leave all to follow him
(<span class="muchsmaller">Luke, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 5</span>).
The simplest is also the truest interpretation
of these words. They literally followed
him; drawn partly by curiosity, partly, perhaps,
by a real spiritual desire for closer acquaintance
with the one whom their teacher designated as
the Lamb of God.</p>


<div class="p2 blockquote">

(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch2_25">2:25</a>; <abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
Mark 2:8, etc.</span>); but because he would
draw them out. In a similar manner he opens
conversation with the woman at the well
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch4_10">4:10</a>, <a href="#ch4_16">16</a></span>), with the disciples fishing at the sea

<a href="#ch21_5">21:5</a></span>), and with the disciples on
their way to Emmaus (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 24:17</span>). Christ <em>as a
conversationalist</em> is a study for the Christian.
Observe how he opens the way and leads on to
familiar acquaintance, first by his question, then
by his invitation, finally by his hospitality.—&#8203;<b>Rabbi
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Master.</b> Rather, <em>teacher</em>, or <em>doctor</em>.
Rabbi is a Hebrew word; <em>teacher</em> (<span lang="el">διδάσκαλος</span>)
is its Greek equivalent. John, writing
for the Gentile world, habitually translates the
Hebrew phrases into their Greek equivalents.—&#8203;<b>Where
dwellest thou?</b> They are timid and
dare not, or at least do not, express their whole
desire. Often in the spiritual reticence, so common
to the first experiences of the awakened
soul, its real aspirations after truth are concealed
beneath an assumed curiosity respecting some
indifferent matter. Christ meets this non-pertinent
if not impertinent curiosity with an
invitation which attaches the two inquirers

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
to him for life.—&#8203;<b>Come and see.</b> Rather,
<em>Come and ye shall see</em>. This is the best reading,
and is given by Alford, Meyer, Tischendorf,
Tregelles, etc. (<span lang="el">ὄψεσθε</span> not <span lang="el">ἴδετε</span>).—&#8203;<b>And abode
with him that day.</b> For the rest of the day.—&#8203;<b>For
it was about the tenth hour.</b> Reckoning
from 6 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, according to Jewish fashion,
this would make it 4 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> Observe, as indicative
of the Evangelist John’s character, and of
the force of the impression made on him from
the outset by Christ, that he remembered not
only the day, <em>but the very hour</em>, of his first
interview with his subsequent Lord. This, too,
is one of those minute touches which would not
be found in either a mythical tradition or an
ecclesiastical forgery.</p>

<p><b>40-42. One of the two *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* was Andrew.</b>
It is the almost universal belief of
scholars that the other was John the Evangelist,
an opinion which rests on the following considerations:
(1) John never mentions himself in his
Gospel; if he refers to himself at all it is never
by name (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch13_23">13:23</a>; <a href="#ch18_15">18:15</a>;
<a href="#ch19_26">19:26</a>; <a href="#ch20_3">20:3</a>;
<a href="#ch21_20">21:20</a></span>). (2)
The name of the other disciple would have been
mentioned if there had not been some special
reason for not mentioning it, and John’s habit
of suppressing his own name constitutes a sufficient
reason; no other plausible reason has been
suggested. (3) The minute accuracy of detail
in this narrative, extending to the specification
of the day and of the hour, justifies the belief
that it is the narrative of an eye and ear witness.
On the life and character of Andrew see note at
close of <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 10, <abbr title="Volume">Vol.</abbr> 1.—&#8203;<b>He first findeth
his own brother.</b> Our English version is
ambiguous if not misleading. The meaning is
not, Before going to Jesus’ residence he found
his own brother, but of the two he was the first
to find Simon. The implication is that both
went in search of him; all three, John, Andrew,
and Simon were probably at the baptism of John
the Baptist, and were his disciples. There is no
evidence to sustain the hypothesis that John
brought his brother James to Jesus at this time,
or even that James was with John at the Jordan.—&#8203;<b>The
Messiah *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* the Christ.</b> One is a
Hebrew, the other a Greek word. The meaning
is the Anointed One. On the spiritual meaning
of the names of Jesus, see note at close of <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 1, <abbr title="Volume One">Vol. I</abbr>.
Andrew’s exclamation of delight
on finding the Messiah, <cite>eureka</cite> (<span lang="el">εὐρήκαμεν</span>, <cite>we
have found</cite>), is the same attributed to Archimedes
on his discovery of the adulteration of
Hiero’s crown. He detected the mixture of
silver in a crown which Hiero had ordered to be
made of gold, and determined the proportions
of the two metals by a method suggested to
him by the overflow of the water when he
stepped into a bath. When the thought struck
him, he is said to have been so pleased that,
forgetting to put on his clothes, he ran home
shouting <cite>Eureka, Eureka, I have found it, I have
found it</cite>. What is the grandest discovery compared
with that which the soul makes when it
finds its Messiah?—&#8203;<b>Thou shalt be called
Cephas, which is by interpretation
Peter.</b> Cephas is Hebrew; Peter is Greek;
both words mean a stone. On the significance
of this change of name, see <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 16:18, note.
At the interview there reported Christ refers to
the name here given, and confirms and interprets
it; at least this is the view of the best Evangelical
scholars, Meyer, Alford, Lange, Schaff;
and it is more reasonable, on the whole, than
the supposition that the Evangelist John anticipates
and reports the change of name out of its
place. The careful student will observe that
here Christ’s language is that of prophecy:
Thou <em>shalt be</em> called Peter; there it is the language
of fulfillment. Thou <em>art</em> Peter. The
apostle did not become Peter till he made the
inspired confession of Christ as the divine
Messiah, which is recorded in Matthew.</p>

to his home, but which it appears to me, from
verse <a href="#ch1_39">39</a>, must have occurred on the following
day; and this is the view of the ancient and of
many of the modern expositors. In that case
the order would be as follows: first day, John’s
conference with the delegation from Jerusalem
(<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch1_19">19-28</a></span>);
second day, John’s public testimony to
Jesus (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch1_29">29-34</a></span>);

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
This is Christ’s first personal call of
a disciple to follow him. There is no evidence
that Philip ever withdrew from this personal
following of Christ as did John and Peter and
Andrew; they did not permanently attach themselves
to Jesus till his subsequent call to them
by the sea of Galilee (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 5:1-11</span>). On Philip’s
life, see note at close of <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 10, <abbr title="Volume One">Vol. I</abbr>. He is
not to be confounded with Philip the deacon,
mentioned in Acts 6:5; 8:5-12, etc.—&#8203;<b>Bethsaida.</b>
There is no good ground for the
hypothesis that there were two towns of this
name on or near the sea of Galilee. The city
was on the northern shore, near the entrance of
the Jordan into the sea. See Mark 6:45, note;
and for illustration of site, <a href="#i_077">John
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 6</a>.—&#8203;<b>Philip
findeth Nathanael.</b> Observe that the young
disciple does not wait, but as soon as he has
found Christ begins to declare his discovery to
others. So with Andrew above (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch1_41">41</a></span>),
with the
woman of Samaria (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
4:28, 29</span>), with Paul after
his conversion (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 9:20</span>).
Nathanael’s name
occurs in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
only here and in John <a href="#ch21_2">21:2</a>.
It is not among the list of apostles furnished by
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 10:2-5; Mark 3:16-19; Luke 6:14-16;
and Acts 1:13. But they all mention, in close
connection with Philip, a Bartholomew, which is
not properly a name but only a patronymic, its
meaning being Son of Tholmai. These facts
have led most scholars to adopt, as a reasonable
hypothesis, the opinion that Nathanael and Bartholomew
are different names for the same
person. The name Nathanael, like our Theodore,
means <dfn>gift of God</dfn>.—&#8203;<b>We have found
him of whom Moses in the law, and the
prophets, did write.</b> The reference is unmistakably
to the Messiah. For references in the
books of Moses to the promised Messiah, see
<abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 3:15 and 17:7, with <abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 3:16, and <abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr>
18:15-19.—&#8203;<b>Jesus of Nazareth, the son of
Joseph.</b> This is the language, not of the Evangelist,
but of Philip. Unquestionably at that
time Philip knew nothing of the supposed birth
of Jesus; to him Jesus was, as to the Nazarenes
subsequently (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 13:54-56</span>), simply the son of
Joseph. The supposed inconsistency of this
language and the account of Christ’s supernatural
birth as given by Matthew, is therefore
purely imaginary.</p>

<p><b>46. Out of Nazareth is it possible that
anything good can come!</b> There is a scornful
emphasis on the word Nazareth not preserved
in our English version. That Nazareth was an
unimportant and insignificant town is indicated
by the fact that it is neither mentioned in the
<abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> nor in Josephus; that the moral condition
of its inhabitants was below that of the
rest of Galilee is indicated by the declaration of
Mark 6:5, 6, and by the mob which threatened
the life of Christ at a time when he was just growing
into popularity elsewhere in Galilee (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 4:28-30</span>).
No other definite reason is known for the
evident odium which attached to Nazareth even
in the minds of Galileans. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 2:23,
note. The question of Nathanael furnishes a
striking illustration of the spirit of prejudice in
even good men. To Nathanael it seems impossible
that the promised Prophet can appear
elsewhere than in or near the city of the Great
King.—&#8203;<b>Come and see.</b> This is the best answer
to make to unbelief. Christ is his own best witness
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch5_34">5:34</a></span>). It is not merely true that “personal
experience is the best test of the truth of
Christianity, which, like the sun in heaven, can
only be seen in its own light” (<cite>Schaff</cite>), but it is
also true that Christ is a greater miracle than
any he ever wrought; and that the supreme
character of Christ carries in itself a moral
conviction to hearts which resist all arguments
drawn from nature. Of this truth John Stuart
Mill, in his Three Essays on Religion, affords a
striking illustration. After considering all the
arguments for the existence and perfection of
the Divine Being derived from nature, and declaring
that Natural Religion points to a Being
“of great but limited power,” “who desires
and pays some regard to the happiness of his
creatures, but who seems to have other motives
of action which he cares more for,” he comes to
the character of Christ, and not only pays a
tribute to it, eloquent and reverent, but adds
his conviction that it would not “even now be
easy, even for an unbeliever, to find a better
translation of the rule of virtue from the abstract
into the concrete, than to endeavor so to live
that Christ would approve our life.” Chrysostom
notices the gentleness and candor of
Philip’s reply; he furnishes a model to all
disputants in dealing with religious prejudice.

19:9; Romans 2:28, 29; <abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 3:29; 6:15, 16.
For <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> description of such an Israelite, see
Psalm 15.—&#8203;<b>In whom is no guile.</b> Therefore,
characteristically unlike the Pharisees, whose
pride it was that they were children of Abraham
(<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 3:8; John
<a href="#ch8_33">8:33</a></span>), and who were full of hypocrisy
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 6:2, 5, 16;
23:14-33</span>).—&#8203;<b>Whence knowest thou
me?</b> As Saul of Tarsus (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 9:5, 6, notes</span>), so
Nathanael is surprised by the Lord’s reading of
his character and inward experience.—&#8203;<b>When
thou wast under the fig-tree.</b> The whole
course of the narrative indicates in this response
a supernatural sight, as in the previous characterization
of Nathanael a supernatural insight.
If Christ had merely chanced to see Nathanael
without being seen by him, this fact would afford,
surely, no basis for Nathanael’s faith, or Christ’s
commendation of it. It seems also clear that
something more is implied than the mere fact
that Christ saw Nathanael under a fig-tree, since
that would neither explain Christ’s commendation
of him as an Israelite without guile, nor
Nathanael’s astonishment. Hence the surmise
of the commentators that he had retired there
for purposes of prayer, and that Christ had
seen him there, like the Israel from whom he
descended (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 32:24-23</span>)
wrestling with God,
for the bestowal of the long-promised blessing
to his realm, in the gift of the Messiah.
It was probably this revelation of the secret
of his soul which caused Christ to characterize
him as a true Israelite, and Nathanael to recognize
in the One who read his inmost life so
perfectly, the King of Israel.—&#8203;<b>The Son of God
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* the King of Israel.</b> The Messiah. See
<abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 2:7; <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 16:16;
Luke 22:70; John
<a href="#ch1_34">1:34</a>; <a href="#ch11_27">11:27</a>.
Observe that Christ recognizes
and accepts this characterization of himself at
the outset of his ministry, a quite sufficient
refutation of the theory of Renan, that it was
the outgrowth of his followers’ later admiration,
and tacitly accepted by Christ at or near the
close of his earthly life. That Nathanael fully
comprehended the meaning of his own confession
is not, however, probable.</p>

<p><b>50, 51.</b> There is some difficulty respecting
the proper interpretation of Christ’s promise
here. The word <cite>hereafter</cite> is rather <dfn>henceforth</dfn>;
but it is omitted by the best critics, <i>e. g.</i>, Alford,
Tischendorf, Lachmann. The figure is undoubtedly
drawn from the vision of Jacob (Israel) of
the ladder between heaven and earth, and the
angels ascending and descending on it (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 28:12</span>).
Some suppose the reference to the angelic appearances
to Christ, and the divine signs given in
attestation of his mission (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 32;
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 4:11; Luke
2:13; 9:29-31; 22:43</span>), but the earlier of these had
already taken place, and Nathanael was neither
present at the temptation, at the transfiguration,
nor at the garden of Gethsemane. Chrysostom
refers in addition to the angelic appearances at
the resurrection, but they by no means furnish a
literal fulfillment of the promise. Some interpret
it spiritually, of the manifest opening of the
heavens and the intercommunication between
earth and heaven, through Jesus Christ. So
Maurice: “Faithful and true Israelite! the vision
to thy progenitor who first bore that name, shall
be substantiated for thee, and for those who
trust in me in lonely hours, through clouds and
darkness, as thou hast done. The ladder set
upon earth and reaching to <span style="white-space:nowrap;">heaven—the</span> ladder
upon which the angels of God ascended and
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">descended—is</span> a ladder for thee and for all.
For the Son of man, who joins earth to heaven,
the seen to the unseen, God and man in one, He
is with you; through Him your spirits may arise
to God; through Him God’s Spirit shall come
down upon you.” Similarly Luther, Calvin,
Tholuck, Alford, and others. But this interpretation
is not wholly satisfactory, since it
converts Christ’s words into an allegory, and
deprives them of all literal meaning. According
to this view the angels are but spiritual blessings,
the open heavens are not seen, and the
angelic appearances are not upon the Messiah,
but through him to mankind. A third interpretation
connects Christ’s words here with his
analogous declarations in <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 25:31; 26:64,
etc., and refers it to his Second Coming. So
Ryle: “When He comes the second time to take
his great power and reign, the words of this
text shall be literally fulfilled. His believing
people shall see heaven open, and a constant
communication kept up between heaven and
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">earth—the</span> tabernacle of God with men, and the
angels visibly ministering to the King of Israel,
and King of all the earth.” I believe that these
three views are congruous and consistent, and
are all embraced in the promise. Christ opened
the communication between earth and heaven;
manifested that fact by the angelic appearances
which accompanied his coming, his presence, and
his departure; still manifests it, by the spiritual
blessings which he constantly confers in answer
to the prayers of his people; and will finally

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
manifest it yet more gloriously when he comes
to take possession of his established kingdom,
with his holy angels with him. The past and
present fulfillments of this prophecy are but
fragmentary and imperfect. The final and
perfect fulfillment awaits us in the future.</p>

<p><b>1, 2. The third day.</b> That is, probably, after
the interview with Nathanael described at the
close of the preceding chapter. Lightfoot says
that, according to Jewish custom, the weddings
of virgins took place on the fourth day of the
week, our Wednesday, and of widows on the fifth
day, our Thursday.—&#8203;<b>There was a marriage.</b>
For description of wedding ceremonies among
the Jews, with illustration of wedding procession,
see <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 25:1-13,
<abbr title="Preliminary">Prel.</abbr> Note.—&#8203;<b>In Cana
of Galilee.</b> The traditional site is Kefr Kenna,
four and one-half miles northwest of Nazareth.
The more probable site is about nine miles north
of Nazareth and six or eight hours from Capernaum.
See Map, <abbr title="Volume One">Vol. I</abbr>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 50. Robinson describes
it as a fine situation, and once a considerable
village of well-built houses. They are now
uninhabited and the whole region is wild and desolate.—&#8203;<b>And
the mother of Jesus was there.</b>
Her name is never mentioned by John. The
fact that Joseph is not mentioned in either of
the Gospels, after Christ’s manhood, has led to
the universal opinion that he was dead. The
presence of Mary, and her apparent authority
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch2_5">5</a></span>), indicates that the bride or bridegroom
were connections or relatives. Different traditions
represent respectively Alphæus, one of his
sons, John the Apostle, and Simon the Canaanite

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
as the bridegroom, but they are all equally untrustworthy.
The Mormons maintain that this
was the marriage of Jesus himself. The student
will observe that it is said of Mary that she <em>was
there</em>, of Jesus that he <em>was called</em>, an indication
that he came at a later period, and probably after
the marriage feast, which usually lasted for several
days, had begun.—&#8203;<b>And his disciples.</b>
Probably those who had already begun to follow
him, though not yet ordained as apostles, nor
summoned by him to leave their regular avocations
to become his constant companions. These
were Andrew, John, Simon Peter, Philip, and
Nathanael, and they were probably invited because
they were with Christ, and out of consideration
for him.</p>

<p><b>3. And the wine failing.</b> Not merely, as
in our English version, when they wanted wine.
The implication is that wine had been provided,
but the supply proved insufficient. Possibly the
unexpected addition of the five disciples of Christ
exhausted it.—&#8203;<b>The mother of Jesus saith
unto him, They have no wine.</b> <em>Why</em> did
she appeal to him? There is certainly no ground
for such an explanation as that of Bengel, that
she meant to give a hint to Jesus and his disciples
to go away! Nor is there any evidence that
she asked him to work a miracle, or even definitely
anticipated or desired it. If she were in
any way responsible for the success of the feast,
and the supply was falling short, the appeal for
help to her son was natural; and it was specially
so, if, as modern customs in the Orient indicate
(see Ellicott’s <cite>Life of Christ</cite>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 118), the
guests often contribute to the supplies at such
entertainments. Along with this desire to do
the bride and bridegroom a favor, there may
have been, as Chrysostom suggests, a desire
through her son to render herself conspicuous,
and a vague and inexpressible feeling that he
could, if he would, supply the want by a miracle,
as Elijah supplied the widow’s cruse (<span class="muchsmaller">1 Kings 17:14-16</span>).
And his <i lang="la">quasi</i> rebuke, if rebuke it be, may
have been addressed to this mother’s vanity.</p>


<div class="p2 blockquote">
<a id="ch2_4"></a>
<p class="hanging">4 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do

</div>

<p><b>4. Woman, what have I to do with
thee? Mine hour is not yet come.</b> Some
question has been made respecting the meaning
of this language. It is clear (1) that <em>woman</em> is
not a harsh term, and involves no tone of rebuke
or reproof; for when Christ on the cross commends
his mother to John’s care, he uses the
same term, “<em>Woman</em>, behold thy son”
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch19_26">19:26</a></span>);
(2) the Greek phrase (<span lang="el">τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοὶ</span>) is properly
rendered in our English version, <cite>What have I to
do with thee?</cite> Though literally capable of the
translation proposed by Dr. Adam Clarke, <cite>What
is this to thee and me?</cite> that is, <cite>What is this to us?</cite>
the uniform usage of the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
forbids this translation.
The Greek is the same in the following
passages, where the translation cannot be other
than that given both there and here.
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 8:29,
note; Mark 1:24; 5:7; Luke 8:28. I can
only understand it as a disclaimer on Christ’s
part of any responsibility in the matter, and an
intimation that in his future mission he was not,
as he had heretofore been, subject unto his
mother. There may also be in it implied a gentle
rebuke of her endeavor to elicit from him some
display of his miraculous power, before the time
for the commencement of his public ministry.
Chrysostom interprets her spirit here by that of
Christ’s brethren (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch7_4">7:4</a></span>), and his reply by his
refusal, later, to turn aside from his work at her
solicitation (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
12:47, 48</span>). Evidently she did not
regard his language as that of refusal, for she
expects his aid, and bids the servants do his bidding.
“She read a <em>yes</em> latent in his apparent
<em>no</em>.”—(<cite>Trench.</cite>)—<b>Mine
hour is not yet come.</b> Not
mine hour to die, though that is usually the signification
of this oft-repeated phrase in John’s
Gospel (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch7_30">7:30</a>; <a href="#ch8_20">8:20</a>;
<a href="#ch12_23">12:23</a>, <a href="#ch12_27">27</a>;
<a href="#ch13_1">13:1</a></span>); but that
would be here meaningless; nor, The hour to
work this miracle, because the wine is not yet
wholly exhausted, or the guests are not conscious
of the lack, and have not asked for supply; but,
The hour for me to begin my public ministry,
accompanied as it is to be with the working of
miracles, the hour for my manifestation. The
Protestant commentaries see in the language
here a rebuke of the spirit of Mariolatry, in this
following the fathers; <i>e. g.</i>, Chrysostom: “The
answer was not that of one rejecting his mother,
but of One who would show her that having
borne him would have availed nothing, had she
not been very good and faithful;” and Augustine:
“As God he has no mother. And now that
he was about to perform a divine work, he
ignores, as it were, the human womb, and asks,
‘Woman, what have I to do with thee?’ as much
as to say, Thou art not the mother of that in me
which works miracles; thou art not the mother
of my Godhead.”</p>

The fact that there were servants, and more than

The water-pots may have set in
the room; more probably in an
ante-room or in the courtyard of
the house. The fact that the water
was provided for purifying is
stated to account for the presence
of so much water; and the reference
to the manner of the Jews is
added for the Gentile readers, for
whom John especially wrote. On
these ceremonial washings, see
Mark 7:2-5, notes. The <dfn>firkin</dfn>
(<span lang="el">μετρητης</span>) is equivalent to 8⅞ gallons;
the whole amount of water,
therefore, was between 100 and
150 gallons. Since the jars were
filled to the brim, the water was
apparent <em>after</em> they were filled;
there was, therefore, no room for
fraud or mistake. The statement of the exact
number and proximate size indicates that we
have here the description of an eye-witness. It
also indicates that there were a large number of
guests.</p>

<p>The quantity of wine made by Christ on this
occasion has been the subject of some hostile
criticism, as though it were an invitation to excessive
drinking. But (1) there is no evidence
that any more wine was created than was used.
Whether it was changed in the stone jars, or as
it was carried to the guests, does not appear;
(2) in Palestine, a wine-growing and wine-consuming
country, where it is not merely <em>a</em> beverage,
but <em>the</em> beverage of the common people,
four or five barrels of wine would not seem so
extraordinary a supply as it would to us, nor
would it produce any such effect in the consumption
as an equal amount of the ordinary wines of
to-day; (3) it is God’s way to pour out his
bounty, not only in abundance, but in superabundance.
As Christ created, not merely barely
enough bread for the 5,000, but the disciples,
after all were fed, gathered up twelve baskets
full, so we may well believe that here he created
not barely sufficient for the hour, but a superabundance
which remained to bless the home
after the departure of the guests. On the probable
character of this wine, <a href="#TOC32">see below</a>, Note on

<p><b>9, 10. The ruler of the feast.</b> The same
word as <dfn>governor of the feast</dfn>, in the preceding
verse. Among the Greeks and Romans, a ruler
of the feast (<dfn>symposiarch</dfn>) was commonly chosen,
usually by lot, who regulated the whole order of
the festivities, proposed the amusements, etc.
A reference in the Apocrypha (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Eccclesiasticus">Eccles.</abbr>
32:1, 2</span>) indicates
that the same practice prevailed among the
Jews. There is no ground for supposing the
ruler of the feast in this case to have been other
than a guest, who occupied this honorary office.—&#8203;<b>But
the servants knew, they having
drawn the water.</b> Not merely, <em>the servants
which drew, knew</em>; the reason of their knowledge
is indicated; they knew because they had themselves
filled the jars with the water, and drawn
it out.—&#8203;<b>Called the bridegroom.</b> Called out
to him, probably across the table. The language
which follows is sportive, and characteristic of
such an occasion of festivity.—&#8203;<b>Every man at
the beginning doth set forth good wine;
and when men are drunken, then that
which is worse.</b> The verb rendered in our
English version “have well drunk” is literally
<dfn>are drunken</dfn>. It is in the passive voice. This
does not necessarily imply that in the East men
counted on the inebriacy of their guests, and for

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
that reason provided the best wine first, still less
that the guests here were intoxicated. “The
man says only in joke, as if it were a general experience,
what he certainly may have often observed.”—(<cite>Meyer.</cite>)
The ancient commentators
have observed the difference between the feasts
of the world and the feasts of Christ; the world
gives its best wine at first, and when men have
become intoxicated with it, then the poor, as the
prodigal son experienced (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 15:13-16</span>); Christ
ever reserves the good wine to the last. See this
thought beautifully drawn out by Jeremy Taylor
in his <cite>Life of Christ</cite>.

<p><b>11. This beginning of miracles.</b> An incidental
and indirect testimony that the miracles
of Christ’s infancy, narrated in the apocryphal
Gospels, are spurious.—&#8203;<em>And manifested forth
his glory.</em> Observe <em>his</em> glory; the miracles of
the disciples did not manifest forth <em>their</em> glory,
but that of their Lord (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 3:8; 14:11-15</span>).—&#8203;<b>And
his disciples believed in him.</b> That is, the
five that had already begun to follow him. But
<em>what</em> or <em>how much</em> they believed is not indicated.
They began to have that confidence in him which
was not consummated till after his resurrection.</p>

<p>In respect to this miracle, observe, (1) <em>The simplicity
of the narrative</em>. John does not directly
assert that the water was made wine, nor that a
miracle was performed, nor does he deduce any
conclusion from the event; he simply narrates
what he saw and <span style="white-space:nowrap;">heard—the</span> jars filled with
water, the contents drawn out, the testimony of
the governor of the feast to the excellence of the
wine carried to him; the reader is left to draw
his own conclusion. (2) <em>The utter failure of all
naturalistic explanations</em>, such as that Christ simply
accelerated the process of nature, or changed
the attributes of the water after the analogy of
mineral waters, so as to give it the taste and appearance
of wine, or that the taste and semblance
of wine was due to a state of spiritual exaltation
on the part of the company, all of which views
have had defenders even among orthodox critics.
See Lange’s and Meyer’s Commentaries for a
statement of these and kindred interpretations.
Meyer well says, respecting them all, “Instead
of a transmutation of water we have a frivolous
transmutation of history.” (3) <em>The impossibility
of deception or fraud.</em> The jars are those belonging
to the household; they are filled to the brim
with water; it is drawn out by the servants; the
judgment respecting the wine is pronounced by
the governor of the feast, who does not know of
the miracle. (4) <em>The analogy of nature.</em> “He
who made the wine at this wedding does the
same thing every year in the vines. As the water
which the servants put into the water-pots was
turned into wine by the Lord, so that which the
clouds pour down is turned into wine by the
same Lord. It excites no wonder in us, because
it occurs every year.”—(<cite>Augustine.</cite>) (5) <em>The
moral and spiritual significance of the miracle.</em>
Contrast Christ’s ready consent to convert water
into wine to add to the festivities of others, with
his refusal to convert stones into bread to supply
his own imperative needs (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 4:3, 4</span>);
his conversion
of water into wine, the symbol of inspiration
and life, with the first miracle of Moses, who
converted water into blood, an instrument and a
symbol of death (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> 7:20, 21</span>)—&#8203;Christ
brings life
and power, Moses brings law and condemnation
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 7:8, 9</span>);
his entrance on his ministry by attendance
on a marriage festivity, and his miracle
to prolong its festivities, with the asceticism of
John the Baptist (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 1:15;
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 3:4</span>). Compare
his inauguration of the new covenant by a miracle
at a marriage with God’s inauguration of the
old covenant by ordaining and creating the marriage
relation (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr>
1:21-24</span>). Notice in this miracle
a type of Christ’s redeeming love, who converts
the water of the law into the wine of the Gospel,
and every soul which hears and obeys his creative
command into an inspiring life-giving spirit
(<span class="muchsmaller">John
<a href="#ch5_21">5:21</a>; <a href="#ch6_33">6:33</a>;
1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 15:45</span>). Observe the fundamental
lesson, that Christ’s example bids us not to withdraw
from the world, nor abstain from its use,
but to use without abusing it
(<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 7:31</span>), and that
the assertion that Christianity bids men “make
this earth as unpleasant to themselves as possible
so as to secure hereafter the joys of heaven,” is
a monstrous perversion of the teaching and example
of Jesus Christ. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>

1. <i>The
facts.</i> These are that Christ inaugurated his
public ministry by attending a wedding feast, and
there by a miracle creating a large quantity of
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">wine—certainly</span> all that the guests could <span style="white-space:nowrap;">use—for</span>
the simple purpose of prolonging the festivities
of the occasion; that he was accustomed
throughout his life to attend social gatherings
where wine was freely used; that he used it
freely himself, notwithstanding the fact that it
subjected him to the reproaches and the misrepresentations
of his enemies (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 11:19;
Luke 7:34</span>);
that he never directly or indirectly condemns the
use of wine, though he does condemn drunkenness
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 24:49;
Luke 12:45</span>); and that he directs
its use by his church as a perpetual memorial of
his atoning love, and employs it as a symbol of
joy and fellowship in the world to come
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:26-29;
Mark 14:22-25; Luke 22:18; 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 10:16</span>).
The force
of this example is strengthened by the reflection
that drunkenness was common in the East before
Christ’s day (<span class="muchsmaller">Esther 1:10; <abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 5:22; 28:7;
<abbr title="Daniel">Dan.</abbr> 5:2-4;
Hosea 4:11</span>), and in Palestine and the neighboring
countries during Christ’s lifetime, so that even
the church of Christ had need of constant admonition
against it (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 24:49; Luke 15:13;
<abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 13:13;
1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 11:21; <abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 5:21;
1 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 4:3</span>); that a Jewish Sect

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
existed, the Essenes (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 3:7,
note</span>), who were
total abstainers, with whom Christ never identified
himself; and that he directly contrasts his
life and example with that of John the Baptist
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 11:19</span>),
who, as a Nazarite, was pledged
against the use of wine and strong drink (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 1:15;
<abbr title="Numbers">Numb.</abbr> 6:3</span>). Attempts have been made to show
that the wine which Christ made on this occasion
and used on other occasions was not fermented.
It is certain that there were in use in the Greek
and Roman world, and presumptively in Palestine,
three kinds of <span style="white-space:nowrap;">wine—fermented</span> wines,
which, however, were unlike our own fiery wines
and contained only a small percentage of alcohol,
and which were usually mixed in the use with
water, in the proportion of two or three parts of
water to one of wine; new wine, made of the
juice of the grape, and, like our new cider, not
fermented and not intoxicating; and wines in
which, by boiling the unfermented juice of the
grape, or by the addition of certain drugs, the
process of fermentation had been stopped, and
the formation of alcohol prevented. It is claimed
that fermented wine was not used at the Passover,
though I can find no other reason for this
opinion than the fact that leavened, <i>i. e.</i>, fermented
bread was prohibited—a prohibition the sole
object of which was to remind the Jews of the
haste of the original passover. Paul’s language
in 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 11:21
(<span class="muchsmaller">see note there</span>) makes it evident that
fermented wine was used by the primitive church
in the administration of the Lord’s Supper; and
the Rabbinical rule, requiring water to be mixed
with the wine at the paschal feast (<span class="muchsmaller">see Lightfoot on
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:27</span>), lest drunkenness should disgrace it,
makes it equally evident that wine was used in
the original <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> festival. There is nothing in
the language of the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> to indicate any discrimination
between fermented and unfermented
wines; Christ himself never directly or indirectly
discriminates between them; neither do any of
his apostles; and it is apparently indicated if
not necessarily implied in the account here, and
in other passages, that it was the ordinary fermented
wine which Christ employed; see especially
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 11:19, “Behold a glutton and a
wine-bibber,” and <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 9:17, “No man having
drunk old (<em>fermented</em>) wine, straightway desireth
new (<em>that of the last vintage and unfermented</em>), for
he saith the old is better.” The language of
Mark 14:25, “I will drink no more of the fruit
of the vine,” etc., plainly implies that he had
been accustomed to drink it freely and as a beverage
with his followers. I judge then that
Christ here made, and throughout his life ordinarily
used, fermented wine; and this is the
nearly unanimous judgment of the best unprejudiced
Biblical scholars. The opposite opinion
is of later origin, an after-thought, the product
not of impartial Biblical research, but of the temperance
reformation. (2) <i>Significance of these facts.</i>
It appears to me clear, in the light of these facts,
that neither Christ’s precept nor his example can
be cited in favor of the doctrine of total abstinence,
as a universal and permanent obligation
from all use of wine, even as a beverage; that it
rather indicates that he recognizes the right and
propriety of so using it; and that the doctrine
and practice of total abstinence must be maintained,
if at all, not by any specific precept, nor
by the general course of Christ’s life, but from
local and perhaps temporary considerations, and
solely on the ground that the Christian must
always be willing to surrender a lawful gratification
for the sake of a higher good, either to himself
or to others (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:29, 30;
<abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 14:21; 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 6:12</span>).
It is equally clear that neither Christ’s precepts
nor his example justifies the ordinary drinking
usages of American society of to-day, with its
bars, its wine-shops, its beer-gardens, its fiery
wines and strong liquors, and all its attendant
evils. The ordinary wine of to-day is a very different
article from that in Christ’s day. The
<em>word</em> is the same, the <em>thing</em> is different. And the
usages are equally different. It is not my province
here to enter into a general discussion of the
temperance question, or even of the Bible teaching
on the subject; but for the convenience of
the student I add, from my <cite>Dictionary of Religious
Knowledge</cite>, a tabular view of the principal Bible
passages which bear on the subject, either for or
against the use of wines.</p>

<p><b>14. In the temple.</b> Historically there were
three temples: Solomon’s (<span class="muchsmaller">1 Kings,
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 6, 7; 2 Chron.,
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 3, 4</span>), the temple of Zerubbabel, constructed at
the time of the restoration under Nehemiah (<span class="muchsmaller">Ezra
3:8-11; 6:3-5</span>), and Herod’s. The latter, named
for its builder, Herod the Great (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
2:1, note</span>), is
the one mentioned here and elsewhere in the
<abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> Its site, established with as much certainty
as any in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>, was a rock platform
in the southeast corner of Jerusalem, now occupied
by the Mohammedan Mosque of Omar. In
its erection ten thousand skilled workmen were
employed; among them one thousand priests
especially instructed in the arts of the stonecutter
and the carpenter. The result was a temple
whose architectural magnificence is thought
never to have been surpassed in ancient or modern
times. It was less a building than a collection
of buildings, and covered an area of over
nineteen acres. The stone was white marble, the
roof cedar, the architecture probably a combination
of the Greek and the Roman. On the east
it overlooked the valley of the Cedron, forming
an effective fortification. It also served as a defence
on the north, where adjoined the tower of
Antonia, the barracks of the Roman soldiery.
On the south a single gateway, on the west four
gateways, gave exit and entrance. On the east
it was connected by a bridge over the Tyrophœan
valley with Mount Zion, the site of Solomon’s
and later of Herod’s palace. The remains
of this bridge have been lately discovered. The
annexed ground plan, from Henry Ward Beecher’s
“Life of Christ,” will enable the reader to
understand the internal structure of the temple.
The illustration in <abbr title="Volume One">Vol. I</abbr>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 257, will give an idea

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
of its external appearance. The reader is there
supposed to be on the Mount of Olives looking
down upon the temple from the east; Mount
Zion with its palaces and towers is in the background;
the long-roofed structure on the left,
that is, the south, is the royal cloister or <i lang="la">Stoa
basilica</i>. This is minutely described by Josephus
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Antiquities">Ant.</abbr>
15:11, 5</span>). It consisted of a nave and two
aisles, the side toward the country being closed
by a wall, that toward the temple proper being
open. It was 105 feet in breadth, 600 feet in
length; the centre aisle was 100 feet high, the
side aisles 50. The roof of cedar was supported
by 102 Corinthian columns of white marble, the
floor was a magnificent mosaic. Between this
cloister and the temple structure was the open
court of the Gentiles. It was open to all, heathen
and Jew alike, and was used for the purpose
of social and intellectual exchange, as well
as for religious processional services. Here
Christ (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 21:23</span>),
and subsequently his disciples
(<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 24:53; Acts 5:21, 42</span>), taught the people. Inscriptions
in Greek and Latin forbade the heathen
from passing beyond this court, under
penalty of death. For a supposed infringement
of this law Paul was mobbed (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 21:26-30</span>). Within
were the successive courts of the women, of
Israel, of the priests. In this latter was the
sacred furniture and utensils, the table of shewbread,
the altar, the laver, etc. In the heart of
this enclosure, investing all with a mysterious
sacredness, was the Holy of Holies, veiled from
even priestly gaze by the curtain, which was
subsequently rent in twain at the time of Christ’s
death (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 27:57</span>).
This Holy of Holies, 90 × 30
feet, is seen in the illustration of the temple as
restored, in the centre of the building; it constituted
the most prominent feature. It was in
the outer court of the Gentiles that the sheep
and cattle and money-changers had gathered.
The scattered Israelites were unable to bring in
person the sacrifices for the altar. The Mosaic
law permitted them to sell their first-fruits, and
with the money purchase their gifts at Jerusalem
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> 14:24-26</span>).
They were also required to
pay for the support of the temple service a half-shekel
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> 3:11-16;
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 17:24-27, notes</span>). This must
be paid in Jewish money, for Gentile coin would
pollute the sacred coffers. Thus, gradually, the
feast-days became great market-days, as they
still are among the nomadic tribes of the Mohammedan
religion. The priesthood, sharing in the
profits, suffered the traffickers gradually to intrude
into and occupy the outer court of the
temple. Thus, not only were the religious services
of the Jews disturbed by the bleating of
sheep, the lowing of cattle, the cooing of doves,
the clangor of the money-changers, and the hum
of a busy market, but the Gentiles were absolutely
driven from all participation in the religious
benefits of the temple. To their exclusion
Christ referred in the second expulsion (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark
11:15-19, note</span>). The priests winked not only at the
sacrilege, but also at the double defrauding of
God and man which accompanied it (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Malachi">Mal.</abbr> 1:7, 8</span>).
The court of the Gentiles was worse than a
market-place; it was a den of thieves. Thus
Christ’s act was not only a vehement protest
against the sacrilege which suffers business to
encroach on the house and worship of God, but
also a rebuke of the bigotry which is indifferent
to the religious wants and worship of men not of
our race, faith, or companionship.—&#8203;<b>Those that
sold cattle, sheep, and doves.</b> For sacrifices
under the Levitical law; sheep, rams, lambs,
goats, kids, bulls, cows, calves, doves, and sparrows
were offered for this purpose. All sacrifices
were required to be offered by the priesthood and
in the temple. On the great feast-days, when
the population of Jerusalem was increased to a
million or more, the traffic must have been both
large and profitable.—&#8203;<b>And the changers of
money.</b> Money-changers had in Greece and
Rome their stalls or tables in the streets and
market-places for the purpose of exchanging the
coin of one nation for another. They are still to
be found in Jerusalem, seated by their little glass
cases, in which are saucers of brass filled with
coins of silver and gold, of every size and value.</p>

<p><b>15, 16. And when he had made a scourge

scourge was made of the rushes which were used
to bed the cattle. Christ picked these up from
the floor and wove them together into a whip.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
Of course this fragile lash would not do much
real execution. It was used as one might use a
switch to alarm and so drive out the animals.
The original shows very clearly that it was used
for this purpose alone, and not to threaten the
men with physical chastisement.—&#8203;<b>He drove all
out of the temple, both the sheep and the
cattle.</b> This is the correct rendering; our
English version is ambiguous and so misleading.—&#8203;<b>And

Poured it out upon the floor. This prevented
their resisting, for it occupied their energies to
pick up and save the coin.—&#8203;<b>And said unto
them that sold doves.</b> It is noteworthy that
he drove out the sheep and cattle, which the
owners could reclaim in the streets, but did not
set the doves free, which would thus have been
lost to their owners. A true Christian indignation
never blinds to the true rights even of the most
flagrant wrong-doers.—&#8203;<b>Make not my Father’s

At the time, not afterward; if this had been
meant it would have been expressed, as in
<abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch2_22">22</a>. It is not here stated that the utterance in
<abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 69:9 was a prophecy
which Christ fulfilled;
simply that his course recalled the language
there. The fact indicates the vigor and intensity
of Christ’s zeal in the manner and spirit of his
action, as well as in the act itself.</p>

<p>This and the subsequent purification of the
temple during the Passion week, indicate in
Christ a vigor and intensity of character, and a
power of indignation, which modern thought
rarely attributes to him. They interpret the
suggestive description of Christ’s personal appearance
given by John in <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 1:13-16, the
only hint of his personal appearance afforded by
the New Testament. We can imagine that in
this expulsion his eyes were as flames of fire, his
feet firm in their tread like feet of brass, his
voice as the sound of the ocean, his words as a
two-edged sword. This indignation was aroused
by (<i>a</i>) the sacrilegious covetousness which made
God’s house a house of merchandise; (<i>b</i>) the
fraud which converted it into a den of thieves;
(<i>c</i>) the selfishness of the bigotry which excluded
the heathen from the only court reserved for
them. It should inspire in his disciples a like
spirit of indignation (<i>a</i>) against the sacrilegious
covetousness which converts the house of God
into a mart of merchandise, whether by the sale
of indulgences, masses, and prayers to others, or
by employing it not for the praise of God but
for the social and pecuniary profit of the pretended
worshipper; (<i>b</i>) against the bigotry which
permits us to look with indifference upon the
exclusion of the poor, the outcast, the despised
from the privileges of God’s house. It is a type
of (<i>a</i>) the cleansing which Christ comes to do for
every soul, which is a temple of God (<span class="muchsmaller">1
<abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 3:16</span>),
and out of which all unclean things must be
driven by the power of God, before it is fit for
God’s indwelling; (<i>b</i>) the final cleansing when
he will come to cast out all things that defile
and work abomination (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 21:27</span>).
Observe that
in Revelation the world is represented as dreading
“the wrath of <em>the Lamb</em>.” Christ’s example
here does not justify the use of physical force
by the church to cleanse it from corruption; for
Christ did not employ physical force. His whip
was not a weapon; the power before which the
traders fled was the moral power of Christ,
strengthened by the concurring judgment of
their own consciences and the moral sense of
the mass of the people (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 11:15, note</span>).</p>

<p><b>18, 19. What sign showest thou unto
us?</b> What evidence of authority to expel from
the temple practices allowed by the priesthood.
They questioned not the right of an inspired
prophet to act thus, but the authority of Jesus
as a prophet. The moral power before which
all quailed was the greatest of signs; but to that
they were indifferent. “They required signs
to be proved by signs.”—(<cite>Bengel.</cite>) No other
authority for any reformation is ever required
than the power and grace to achieve it. The
same question was repeated at the second cleansing,
but it elicited a very different answer (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
21:23</span>).—&#8203;<b>Destroy this temple and in three
days I will raise it up.</b> In interpreting this
passage observe that (1) John himself explicitly
declares Christ’s meaning, “He spake of the
temple of his body” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch2_21">21</a></span>); (2) that not only
the Jews, who might have willfully perverted
Christ, misunderstood his meaning, but his own
followers did not, till after his death, understand
him (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch2_22">22</a></span>); hence (3) the hypothesis that he
pointed to himself when he said, “Destroy this
temple,” is not only unnecessary but improbable.
The words are a prophecy, but are purposely left
enigmatical, to be interpreted by the event. The
temple is itself a type of man, who is intended
to be the temple of God, in which he will dwell;
and therefore a type perfectly fulfilled only in
Christ, in whom alone the Spirit of God dwelt
without measure, and with no periods of partial
or complete exclusion. The Jews in crucifying
Christ destroyed the divine reality of which the
building was only a symbol or prophecy; moreover

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
they inaugurated that terrible drama of
passion which ended in the literal destruction
of the temple itself. For description of this
destruction see <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 24, <abbr title="Preliminary">Prel.</abbr> Note. Some
objections to this passage have been suggested.
(1) <cite>The crucifixion of Christ and his resurrection
taking place three years later cannot be a sign of
his authority here.</cite> Ans. In fact Christ does not
comply with the Pharisees’ demand for a sign
but refuses it, as in the analogous passage in
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 12:34-40, where he also by a metaphor
refers to his resurrection. (2) <cite>The prophecy
would not be and in fact was not understood.</cite> Ans.
It was not intended to be understood then, but
to afford a basis for the faith of the disciples
when subsequent history had interpreted it. It
was an enigma more likely to be remembered
because enigmatical. “Many such sayings he
uttered which were not intelligible to his immediate
hearers, but which were to be so to those
who should come after. And wherefore doth
he do this? In order that when the accomplishment
of his predictions should have come to
pass, he might be seen to have foreknown from
the beginning what was to follow.”—(<cite>Chrysostom.</cite>)
(3) <cite>The language is imperative and thus
involves a command by Christ to crucify him.</cite> Ans.
The imperative, <cite>Destroy this temple</cite>, is not equivalent
to the future, You will destroy this temple;
nor is it permissive merely, You may destroy
this temple; nor yet is it a command, You must
destroy this temple. It is a challenge. Destroy
this temple, and I will raise it up. “It springs
from painfully excited feelings, as he looks with
heart-searching gaze upon that implacable opposition
which was already beginning to show
itself, and which would not be satisfied till it
had put him to death.”—(<cite>Meyer.</cite>) (4) <cite>The language,
I will raise it up, imputes to Christ the
power of the resurrection which is uniformly
attributed to the Father.</cite> Ans. This objection
is founded on a misapprehension. The <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
recognizes no such distinction between the
Father and the Son as this objection implies,
and Christ uses language elsewhere, as distinctly
implying his own act in the resurrection as that
used here (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch10_18">10:18</a>; <a href="#ch11_25">11:25</a>;
<abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> <a href="#ch5_39">5:39</a>,
<a href="#ch5_40">40</a>, <a href="#ch5_44">44</a></span>). The
interpretation proposed by some writers, that
Christ here speaks of the decay of the Jewish
religion in its temple, and the building up of a
new spiritual theocracy, will not be accepted by
those who believe that John’s explicit declaration
of Christ’s meaning is inspired and authoritative.
Observe how the Jews intentionally
misrepresented Christ’s saying; they accused
him of threatening to destroy the temple (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
26:61, note</span>), when he had really prophesied that
they would destroy it.</p>

name was not necessarily a true spiritual acceptance
of him as a personal Saviour from sin; the
reverse is implied by the statement that they
trusted him <em>because they saw his miracles</em>; and
still more by the declaration respecting himself
that he did not entrust himself to them; (3) this
declaration would scarcely need interpretation
were it not for a common misinterpretation. It
does not imply that he held back from them his
doctrine, or refused to work miracles for their
benefit, but simply that he did not and could
not enter into that close and unreserved personal
intercourse with them which characterized
his Galilean life and companionships. He knew
them too well to do this; knew that when the
spiritual and universal nature of his kingdom of
love was revealed unto them, they would reject
and crucify him. The statement that he knew
what was <em>in man</em>, indicates a divine and supernatural
reading of the secrets of the human
heart, of which the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> affords many and
striking illustrations (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
9:4; Mark 2:8; Luke 7:39,
40</span>). The declaration that he knew <em>all men</em>,
indicates that this interior knowledge of the
heart was not occasional and exceptional, but
universal. Melancthon sees in the example of our
Lord here an admonition of caution in opening our
hearts unreservedly to strangers, even though
they may seem to receive our word with kindness.
Be friendly to all, be intimate with few.</p>

<p>Christ’s interview with Nicodemus is described
only by John. It occurred immediately after the
events described in the preceding chapter, and
before Christ had inaugurated his missionary
labors, which he did not begin till the imprisonment
of John the Baptist (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 1:14</span>). In studying
this passage, the following considerations
will prevent the student from falling into the
perplexities and errors into which some learned
and orthodox commentators have fallen. (1) The
conversation was had at the commencement of
Christ’s ministry, before he had explained, even
to his own disciples, the principles of his kingdom;
we cannot therefore safely assume that
Nicodemus was familiar with those principles,
nor can we interpret Christ’s teachings here by
the later apostolic teaching, except in so far as
that was developed from this as from a germ.
(2) Nicodemus was a Pharisee, therefore a formalist,
and pre-eminently a Jew. We may safely
assume that Christ’s object was in part to correct
Jewish and Pharisaic errors, and our first object
must be to understand, if we can, Nicodemus’
understanding of our Lord. (3) There is no evidence
that John was present at this interview;
and it is not probable that we have a full verbatim
report of it. The structure of the narrative
indicates that only so much of the conversation
is reported as was necessary to make clear Christ’s
discourse founded thereon.</p>

is known except what John tells us. He is not
mentioned by the other Evangelists; and subsequent
traditions are untrustworthy. There is a
Nicodemus referred to in the Talmud; but there
is nothing to identify him with this one, for the

incidents related of him are this conference, his
protest against condemning Jesus unheard

and his participation with Joseph of Arimathea

a spurious Gospel of Nicodemus, the author of

was one of the Sanhedrim, and this indication is

belonged.</p>

<p><b>2. The same came to Jesus by night.</b>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
Why <em>by night</em>? The reason generally assumed is
fear of the Jews; but this is not asserted by the
Evangelist, and at this time there had not been
developed any pronounced hostility on the part
of the Judeans to Jesus. Nicodemus may have
had a natural reluctance to commit himself to an
unknown Rabbi, till he had learned more of his
doctrine; he may have simply sought a quiet and
personal conversation, such as he could not obtain
in the busy day-time.—&#8203;<b>Rabbi, we know
that thou art a teacher.</b> The plural is not
used here for the singular number; Nicodemus
expresses not merely his own personal conviction,
but that of the Pharisees as a class. That they
did, even much later, recognize Christ’s superhuman
character and mission is clear from such
passages as <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 12:23, 24;
John <a href="#ch9_29">9:29-34</a>;
<a href="#ch11_47">11:47</a>, and this even when they resisted him
most bitterly.—&#8203;<b>For no man can do these
miracles</b>, etc. This is the argument from miracles
put in the tersest possible form. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>
Acts 4:16, 17. And this is all that miracles
prove, namely, the commission and authority of
Christ; they do not of themselves show his <em>character</em>.
Nicodemus then regards Christ as a
<em>prophet sent from God</em>; and John, who in
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch1_6">1:6</a>,
etc., has drawn clearly the distinction between
the prophet and the Light and Life, reports in
this conversation with Nicodemus a discourse of
Christ in which he emphasizes the same distinction.
Nicodemus impliedly asks to know what
<em>new doctrine</em> Christ has to teach; Christ replies
in substance that the world needs not new doctrine,
but <em>new life</em>. The key to the understanding
of this conversation is the contrast between
the two conceptions of religion, as a system of
doctrine, and as a new and spiritual life.</p>

<p><b>3. Verily, verily.</b> With Christ these words
are a common precursor of any especially weighty
and solemn declaration (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:18, note</span>).—&#8203;<b>Except
a man be begotten anew, he cannot see
the kingdom of God.</b> On the meaning of this
sentence, it is to be observed that, (1) The word
(<span lang="el">γεννάω</span>) here rendered in our English version
<dfn>born</dfn>, more properly signifies the act of begetting.
Here therefore Christ’s language carries Nicodemus
back to the very beginning of life. (2) The
word (<span lang="el">ἄνωθεν</span>) rendered here in our English version
<dfn>again</dfn>, is certainly mistranslated. It means
either <dfn>anew, i. e., from the beginning</dfn> or <dfn>from above</dfn>.
Both meanings are attached to it here by the best
scholars. According to the first definition, Christ
simply implies that the life must begin anew,
that the character must be rebuilt from the foundation,
without however implying how; according
to the other idea, he indicates in the use of
this word not only a new but a spiritual and
divine birth. The word is used in the first sense
in Luke 1:3, where it is rendered <cite>from the very
first</cite>; in the second sense in James 1:17; 3:15,
17, where it is rendered <cite>from above</cite>. It is clear
that Nicodemus understood it in the former
sense merely, and therefore I have so rendered it
here. (3) The word rendered <cite>see</cite> (<span lang="el">ἰδεῖν</span>) is not
equivalent to <dfn>enter into</dfn> (<span lang="el">εἰσελθεῖν</span>), as Meyer interprets
it. The declaration is explicit that a
new spiritual life is necessary, not only to enter
into but even to form any correct conception of
the kingdom of God. And with this agrees the
teaching of Christ elsewhere (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 13:14, 15</span>), and
of Paul (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 2:9, 14, 15</span>). Christ thus declares to
Nicodemus that he cannot even understand the
spiritual teachings of the new religion without
first beginning a new life. In other words, <cite>a new
spiritual life is the condition precedent to a correct
spiritual apprehension of Christ’s teaching</cite>. It is
further to be observed that light is thrown on
the meaning of this declaration by a consideration
of previous Rabbinical and of later Apostolic
teaching. The new birth was a familiar metaphor
with the Rabbis. They held that a Gentile
in becoming a Jewish proselyte, and submitting
to circumcision and baptism, was born again.
Old things passed away; all things became new;
it was even maintained that the proselyte might
marry his nearest kin without offence, because
the old relationships were annulled by his new

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
birth. Christ employs this metaphor, familiar
to the Jewish Rabbi, without interpreting it,
and declares that no man, <em>Jew or Gentile</em>, could
see the kingdom of God without undergoing a
change as radical. This truth, that a man may
bury his old life and begin a new one, with something
of the freshness and hope of youth, is also
foreshadowed in the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 1:18, 19; <abbr title="Jeremiah">Jer.</abbr> 31:33;
<abbr title="Ezekiel">Ezek.</abbr> 11:19, 20; 36:26</span>), and underlies the teaching of
the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr>
6:8; 8:3; 12:2; 2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 5:17; <abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 6:15;
<abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 2:1-8; <abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 3:9, 10; Titus 3:5</span>); and the metaphor
itself frequently occurs in the teaching of the
apostles (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:15; James 1:18; 1 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr>
1:3; 1 John 3:9</span>).</p>

<p class="hanging">4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be

</div>

<p><b>4. How can a man be born when he is
old?</b> It seems to me clear that this question is
asked in a spirit of irony. So Godet, Alford,
Luther, and others. Considering that the metaphor
was a common one, as Lightfoot has shown,
and that the doctrine of a new life inspired from
God could not have been unknown to any devout
student of the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> (<span class="muchsmaller">see references above</span>),
it is hardly
possible to suppose that Nicodemus took Christ
literally. This is however Meyer’s interpretation
of the question; but it represents Nicodemus as
not only “a somewhat narrow-minded man,” but
also as a grossly ignorant and stupid one; and
so, in truth, Meyer represents him throughout.</p>

<p>In the following verses (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch3_5">5-8</a></span>),
Christ answers
Nicodemus’ threefold question: <em>first</em>, by simply
reasserting his declaration that no man can see
the kingdom of God unless he is born anew;
<em>second</em>, by declaring the nature of this new birth,
as the commencement of a new spiritual life, not
of a new physical or fleshly life; and <em>third</em>, by
borrowing an illustration from nature to indicate
the degree of knowledge attainable by man on
this subject; he can perceive the results of the
operations of the spirit of God, but he cannot
trace them to their source nor comprehend their
laws.</p>

<p><b>5. Born of water and of Spirit.</b> Governing
ourselves by the cardinal canon, that we are
to understand Christ as Christ expected his
auditor to understand him, it cannot be difficult
to understand this declaration. The Jewish
proselyte, as a sign that he put off his old faiths,
was baptized on entering the Jewish church.
John the Baptist, employing the same symbolic
rite, baptized Jew as well as Gentile, as a sign of
purification by repentance from past sins. The
Sanhedrim were familiar with his baptism, and
had sent a delegation to inquire into it
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_19">1:19</a>, <a href="#ch1_25">25</a></span>),
and he had told them prophetically of the
baptism of the Spirit which Christ would inaugurate.
Nicodemus then would certainly have understood
by Christ’s expression, “born of water,”
a reference to this rite of baptism, and by the
expression, “born of the Spirit,” a reference to
a new spiritual life, which however he could
have only imperfectly apprehended. The declaration
then is that no man can enter the kingdom
of God except by (1) a <em>public</em> acknowledgment
and confession of sin, a <em>public</em> putting off of the
old man and entering into the new; and (2) a real
and vital change of life and character wrought
by the Spirit of God in the heart of the believer.
By the one act he enters into the visible and external
kingdom; by the other, into the spiritual
and invisible kingdom. That a <em>public</em> confession
and consecration is essential is clearly indicated
elsewhere in Christ’s teaching (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 10:32, 33</span>).
Observe the difference in phraseology here and
in verse 3. He cannot <em>see</em> the kingdom of God,
except his eyes are opened by the Spirit of God;
he cannot <em>enter</em> it, except by a public and complete
abandonment of the old and a spiritual
consecration to the new life (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 5:14-16</span>).</p>

The connection is this: even if a man when he is

of the Spirit partakes of the Spirit of God.
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>

coupled with
John’s explicit declaration in <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>

<p><b>7. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye
must be born again.</b> The original, by its construction,
puts an emphasis on the word <em>ye</em>. And
it was this which surprised Nicodemus; not that
men must be born again, but that this necessity
was laid on him, a child of Abraham, and an honored
ruler and teacher among the Jews. Observe
too that he says <em>ye</em>, not <em>we</em>. “The Lord did not,
could not say this of Himself. Why? Because,
in the full sense in which the flesh is incapacitated
from entering the kingdom of God, He was
not born of the flesh. He inherited the weakness
of the flesh, but his spirit was not like that of
sinful man, alien from holiness and God, and
therefore on Him no sentence hath passed; when
the Holy Spirit descended on Him at His baptism,
the words spoken by the Father were indicative
of past approval, not of renewal. His obedience
was accepted as perfect, and the good pleasure
of the Father rested on Him. Therefore He includes

not himself in this necessity for the new
birth.”—(<cite>Alford.</cite>)</p>

<p><b>8.</b> It is very difficult to convey the exact meaning
of the original of this verse; for in the original
the same word signifies <dfn>wind</dfn> and <dfn>spirit</dfn>; there
is thus a verbal felicity in the metaphor, a certain
play upon the word itself, which cannot be transferred
from the Greek into another language.
As in nature we see the operation of the summer
breeze, that comes we know not whence, and
goes we know not whither, so in the kingdom of
grace we see the effects of the Spirit of God, in
changes wrought in the individual character and
in the community (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 5:22</span>), but are unable to
comprehend the nature of the influence or the
laws according to which it operates. Christ
by this metaphor certainly indicates something
more than the mere incomprehensibleness of the
Spirit’s work (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> <abbr title="Eccclesiasticus">Eccles.</abbr> 11:5</span>); he indicates also
the realm in which we are to conduct our investigations,
and that from which, by the nature of
the case, we are excluded. We can study to advantage
the <em>results</em> of the Spirit’s operations; but
all endeavors to know <em>how He</em> operates, what are
the occult laws of <em>His</em> being and work, are in
vain. A humble acceptance of this teaching
would eliminate many useless discussions from
theology. Alford notices that the Greek word
used for wind (<span lang="el">πνεῦμα</span>) indicates the gentle breath
of summer, not the violent gale. “It is one of
those sudden breezes springing up on a calm day,
which has no apparent direction, but we hear it
rustling in the leaves around.” Observe also in
the language, <em>where it listeth</em>, an indication of the
fact that the divine operations are free, unconstrained,
and not answerable to man, nor subject
to his control. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 9:15, 16.</p>

aside cavilling, and asks seriously for clearer light.
For similar effect of Christ’s personal power on a
skeptical nature, compare his conference with
the Samaritan woman (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch4_11">4:11</a> with <a href="#ch4_25">25</a></span>),
and with

<a href="#ch18_33">18:33-38</a> with <a href="#ch19_9">19:9-12</a></span>);
compare also account
of Paul before Festus and Agrippa (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 26:31,
32</span>). Observe that Christ does not overcome
Nicodemus’ skepticism by arguing against his
objections, but by the mere power of his own
personal assurance of the truth.—&#8203;<b>Thou art the
teacher of Israel; and dost thou not know
these things?</b> There is certainly in this declaration
and question a touch of irony and of rebuke.
The necessity of a radical change of heart
and life, for Israelite as well as Gentile, is abundantly
taught by the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>
(<span class="muchsmaller">see <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch3_3">3</a>, note, for references</span>);
Nicodemus, as a professional teacher of the religion
of the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>, ought not to have been surprised
at Christ’s reiteration of the truth; and
the less because the doctrine of a new birth and
a public baptism as a symbol of it were taught by
the Rabbis to the Gentiles. The language here,
<em>The</em> teacher of Israel (<span lang="el">ὁ διδάσκαλος</span>) indicates that
Nicodemus was a well-known teacher; perhaps
that he prided himself on his pre-eminence.</p>

<p><b>11, 12. We speak that we do know</b>, etc.
Christ has spoken hitherto only of that which
is matter of common observation, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, man’s
need of a new and divine life, and the apparent
results of it in character and conduct. He now
speaks of that which is matter of personal experience
with Him, the new life in the soul. He
now becomes not merely an interpreter to facts
that are patent, but also a <em>witness</em> to facts that
are not. Christian teaching, to be effectual,
must always be founded on personal experience
of the truth taught (<span class="muchsmaller">1
<abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 2:12, 13</span>).—&#8203;<b>Earthly
things ... heavenly things.</b> The connection
of these verses with the preceding interprets
the contrast which Christ here indicates.
Nicodemus has impliedly asked for an
exposition of Christ’s system of truth. Christ
has replied by saying that no man can understand
the truths that pertain to the kingdom of
God unless he is born again. This necessity of a
radical change in heart and life in order to appreciate
divine things is an earthly fact, easily tested
by an observation of men; a striking evidence
of it is afforded by the question of Nicodemus
in verse <a href="#ch3_4">4</a>. He then immediately goes on
to ask how such a change can be effected. But
this, the method of God’s work in anew creating
the heart, is a heavenly thing, not a matter of
observation; and Christ says, If you do not believe
me when I tell you a truth which you can
easily verify by studying the earthly life of men,
what use is there in my telling you the secrets of
God’s working, the truth of which disclosure
you have no means of verifying. Observe the
implication that the things which are earthly,
literally, <dfn>upon the earth</dfn> (<span lang="el">ἐπίγεία</span>), belong to us to
study and know, and the things which are heavenly,
literally, which take place <em>in the</em> heavens

(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> 29:29</span>). And yet by far the largest
proportion of theological conflicts have taken
place respecting these hidden things, concerning
God’s eternal counsels not man’s present duty.</p>

<p><b>13.</b> The key to the interpretation of this verse
is to be found in its context and connection.
Christ says: How shall ye believe if I tell you of
things which take place in heaven; yet no one
else can tell you, for no one has ascended into
heaven, and no one therefore can report its secrets,
except he who has descended from heaven
and is in continual communion with heaven. So
interpreting it, observe, (1) The declaration, <dfn>No
one</dfn> (not merely no man) <dfn>hath ascended up to
heaven</dfn>, means no living person; it does not militate
against the doctrine of the resurrection of
the dead, nor imply an unconscious or even an
intermediate state. It is by the connection limited
to those living on the earth, for they alone
could reveal the secrets of heaven if acquainted
with them. (2) <dfn>He that came down from heaven</dfn>
plainly implies the pre-existence and supernatural
character and origin of Jesus Christ
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_58">8:58</a></span>).
He contrasts himself with other men, patriarchs,
prophets, apostles, as the <em>only one</em> who has
descended to earth from heaven. (3) <dfn>Which is
in heaven</dfn> indicates not merely, as Meyer apparently
interprets it, that Christ’s proper abode
and home were in heaven, but also that he maintained
a vital and continuous communion therewith,
dwelling in the Spirit in heaven, even while
in the flesh upon earth. The Christian’s experience
interprets, though it does not fully measure,
this mystery of the heavenly life in the flesh (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr>

<p><b>14, 15. As Moses lifted up the serpent
in the wilderness.</b> The reference here is to
the event recorded in <abbr title="Numbers">Num.</abbr> 21:4-9. The account
there should be carefully studied and compared
with the spiritual interpretation which
Christ affords here. What species are there indicated
by the description “fiery serpent” is not
very clear; probably the title was given from the
burning sensations produced by their bite. Travelers
describe a large serpent, said to abound in
the Arabian peninsula, full of fiery red spots and
undulating stripes, and regarded as one of the
most poisonous of the serpent kind. Excruciating
heat and a burning thirst are among the symptoms
produced by the bite of this serpent. The
brazen serpent described in Numbers is thought
to have been put upon a pole and carried throughout
the camp, so as to bring it within the sight
of all the people. It was carefully preserved and
carried into the Holy Land, where it became an
object of idolatry and was destroyed in the reformation
instituted under Hezekiah (<span class="muchsmaller">2 Kings 18:4</span>).
A Roman Catholic church at Milan, Italy, however,
still claims to possess the original brazen
serpent.—&#8203;<b>Must the Son of Man be lifted up.</b>
Why <em>must</em>? What is the necessity? That question
Christ does not answer here, nor, so far as I
can see, does the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> anywhere. It simply
represents the atoning sacrifice of Christ as a necessity,
without explaining the grounds of that
necessity (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> Luke 24:26</span>). That it is in the divine
economy of grace an inexorable necessity is indicated
even by the types of the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Leviticus">Lev.</abbr> 17:11;
<abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 9:22</span>). The phrase “Son of Man” was a
common Jewish designation for the Messiah. It
would have been so understood by Nicodemus
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 10:23, note</span>).—&#8203;<b>Be lifted up.</b> Not only <em>on the
cross</em>, but <em>by the cross unto glory</em>. It is the cross
which lifts up Christ to be the object of adoration
for the whole creation (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:9; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr>
5:9</span>).—&#8203;<b>Should
not perish.</b> These words are wanting
in the best manuscripts. But the doctrine implied,
that those who do not believe will perish,
is clearly taught in verse <a href="#ch3_16">16</a>, from which it was
probably borrowed and inserted here by some
early copyist.—&#8203;<b>Eternal life.</b> The same Greek
words are rendered everlasting life in the next
verse (<span lang="el">ζωὴν αἰώνιον</span>). <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch10_10">10:10</a>. Eternal
life is the life of the soul which disaster cannot
impair nor death destroy—a present possession,
not a future inheritance, except that it is a possession
which grows in value and importance in
the future.</p>

<p>In studying Christ’s language in these two
verses observe (1) That we have Christ’s authority
for the doctrine that the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> history is
intended to indicate, by types or object-teaching,
the great truths of the Gospel. This he
assumes elsewhere in his ministry (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 22:15, 19,
20; John 6:49-51</span>), and it is directly asserted by Paul
(<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 10:11</span>), and underlies the Epistle to the
Hebrews. The history of the brazen serpent is
then a parable of the Gospel; parabolically it
points out the way of salvation. (2) The serpent
is throughout the Bible an emblem of Satan, and
its poison an emblem of the deadly and pervasive
effects of sin (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 3:1, 14, 15; <abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> 32:33; Psalm
58:4, 5; 140:3; <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 3:13;
2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 11:3; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 12:9</span>). It
is a fitting <span style="white-space:nowrap;">emblem—slight</span> in its first wound,
affecting the blood, the current and fountain of

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
life, pervading the whole frame with its subtle
poison, a poison for which there is no human
remedy, and resulting in certain death. (3) For
the human soul, poisoned by sin, the end whereof
is death (<span class="muchsmaller">James 1:15</span>), there is lifted up One who,
though he knew no sin, was made in the likeness
of sinful flesh (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 6:21</span>), so that in him the
enemy himself was, as it were, nailed to the
cross (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 2:15</span>). Thus, as the brazen serpent
represented the fiery serpent, yet had in him
not poison but healing, so Christ represented
sinful flesh, but had in him no sin but redemption
from the poison of sin in others. (4) The
one only condition of healing to the poisoned
Israelite was that he <em>look on</em> the brazen serpent;
and this simply as an act of obedient faith. To
this fact Isaiah had reference in his interpretation
of the divine condition of salvation, “Look
unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the
earth; for I am God, and there is none else”
(<span class="muchsmaller">Isaiah 45:22</span>). So here to “believe in him” is not
to believe some doctrine about the Messiah, but
simply to trust in him, to look unto him (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts
16:31; <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 12:2</span>). (5) The work of heralding the
Gospel is the work of Moses in the wilderness.
It is a simple pointing to the Saviour, lifted up
that the sinner, by looking unto him, may be
saved. The work of instruction in the precepts
of Christ and the principles of his kingdom
comes after, not before, salvation (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 28:19,
20, note</span>).</p>

<p><b>16.</b> Some scholars, including Olshausen and
Tholuck, suppose that Christ’s discourse ends
with the preceding verse, and that the remainder,
to verse <a href="#ch3_21">21</a>, are added by John; but the
grounds for such an hypothesis seem to me
quite insufficient, and the objections to it quite
conclusive. The grounds are (<i>a</i>) <em>That all allusion
to Nicodemus is henceforth dropped</em>. But
Nicodemus is only introduced as an interrogator,
because his questions elicit the instruction of
Jesus; and only so much of his share in the
conversation is recorded as is necessary to make
Christ’s language intelligible. (<i>b</i>) <em>Thenceforth
past tenses are used.</em> This might, however, well
be the case, even if the events were future, the
discourse being prophetic. But the events were
not future, but past. The love of God, the
sending his Son into the world, the opening of
the door of salvation through <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Him—all</span> this was
already accomplished; and the passion is not
described in detail as an event past. (<i>c</i>) <em>The
phrase “only begotten” is said to be peculiar to
John.</em> But Stier well replies that John probably
obtained the phrase from Christ. The objections
to the view which supposes that Christ ends the
discourse at verse <a href="#ch3_15">15</a>, and that the rest is John’s
are, (<i>a</i>) That the discourse breaks off abruptly, if
ended at verse <a href="#ch3_15">15</a>, leaving Nicodemus in entire
ignorance of the way of salvation. The same
necessity which, on this hypothesis, led John to
complete it, would much more have led Christ
to complete it. (<i>b</i>) There is nothing to indicate
a break at verse <a href="#ch3_15">15</a>; and to suppose John guilty
of adding to the discourse of our Lord his own
words, without indicating that it is an addition,
is to accuse him of imposture, if not forgery, and
casts discredit over his whole narrative. Lange,
Stier, Meyer, Alford, all hold the discourse to
be our Lord’s to the end, at verse <a href="#ch3_21">21</a>. The verse
itself has been well called by Luther “The little
gospel,” for it embodies the whole gospel in a
single sentence. It declares the divine <span style="white-space:nowrap;">nature—love</span>
(<span class="muchsmaller">1 John 3:9, 16</span>); the nature of that love, a
love unto self-sacrifice, the sacrifice of his Only
Son; the object of that <span style="white-space:nowrap;">love—the</span> whole world;
the result of that <span style="white-space:nowrap;">love—the</span> gift of the Messiah;
the divine nature of the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Messiah—God’s</span> only
begotten Son; the object of that <span style="white-space:nowrap;">gift—salvation;</span>
the sole condition of securing the benefits of that
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">gift—trust</span> in the Saviour; the proffer of that
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">salvation—to</span> all that believe in him; the effect
of rejecting <span style="white-space:nowrap;">it—perishing;</span> the effect of accepting
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">it—everlasting</span> life. Observe, (1) that all
attempts to limit the meaning of the word
<em>world</em> (<span lang="el">ὁ κόσμος</span>) to the elect, or the church, are
inconsistent with the original and with other
parallel passages of Scripture. See particularly
1 John 2:2, and <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 13:38, note; (2) the
cause of the atonement is traced here not to the
wrath but to the <em>love</em> of God, a fundamental fact
often lost sight of in presenting that doctrine;
(3) in the original an emphasis is put upon the
word <em>so</em>, which is not preserved in the English
version. The wonder of the Gospel is not that
God loved the world, but that he loved it with
such a love, a love which only the sacrifice of an
only begotten Son can interpret.</p>

The Jews believed (see <cite>Lightfoot</cite>) that the Messiah

Isaiah 21:12, “The morning cometh and also
the night.” “It will be the morning to Israel
(when the Messiah shall come), but night to the
(Gentile) nations of the world.” This error
Christ refutes, in this his first private preaching
of the Gospel, as subsequently in his first public
preaching (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 4:25-27</span>); he declares that he
brings salvation to the whole world. Alford
notices the peculiar construction of the close of
the verse, not, That he might save the world,
but, That the world through him might be
saved. “The free will of the world is by this
strikingly set forth in connection with verses
<a href="#ch3_19">19</a>, <a href="#ch3_20">20</a>.
Not that the Lord is not the Saviour of

(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 3:12</span>);
for he that trusts in Christ is thereby taken out
from judgment, while he that rejects Christ
condemns himself. The next verse states the
ground and the nature of this condemnation.
The Light has come into the world, and men by
refusing the Light attest their love of darkness;
and it is for this, not for the darkness but for
their <em>love</em> of it, that they are condemned.—&#8203;<b>Is not

sinner is condemned, not by Christ but by his
own act; he is <em>self-condemned</em> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Titus">Tit.</abbr> 3:11</span>). Observe,
that throughout the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> both condemnation
and salvation are represented as <em>present</em> realities,
not as future possibilities. The last judgment
<em>decides</em> nothing; it simply announces publicly
the results of the judgment now forming. <cite>Life
is the true judgment-day.</cite>—<b>Because he hath
not believed.</b> Men are not condemned for
their deeds but for their desires. The way of
escape from the evil is provided and declined; and
for this the soul is condemned. Thus it is true
that the Lamb of God taketh away the sin of
the world (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_29">1:29</a></span>) and yet condemns the sinner
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch15_22">15:22</a></span>), because the condemnation is not for
the past sin, but for the present rejection of the
Saviour from sin.—&#8203;<b>In the name of the only

<i>i. e.</i>, Saviour, and was given to him because “he

Thus the incarnation is the fundamental doctrine
of Christianity; as Christ is himself emphatically
the Truth, so every Christian must be
in a smaller measure an embodiment and incarnation
of divine truth, manifesting it less by
his words than by his life. So, on the other
hand, Paul catalogues the vices of life, as the
things which are contrary to “sound doctrine”
(<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 1:10</span>). For an exemplification of what it
is to do the truth, see Psalm 15.—&#8203;<b>That they
are wrought in God.</b> The Christian comes to
the light, not for self-glorification, but to glorify
God; his desire is not to manifest the goodness
in himself, but the goodness in God which has
triumphed over the evil in himself (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:16;

Jerome and Eusebius both affirm that Salim

found a Mussulman oratory called Sheyk Salim
about six miles south of Scythopolis, and two
miles west of the Jordan. Dr. Hackett seems to
think this the more probable site. This places
it near the northern border of Samaria.—&#8203;<b>Because

personal jealousy in this complaint. To their

<p><b>27, 28. A man can receive nothing
except it be given him from heaven.</b>
Some, as Alford and Maurice, suppose that
John refers to himself, saying in effect: I cannot
take more than God has given me, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, the
mission of a herald; others, as Chrysostom,
that he refers to Jesus. This latter seems to
me clearly the true view, which has been abandoned,
perhaps, from a reluctance to apply the
principle involved in it to Christ, that whatever
power he possessed was not independent but
derived from the Father. The connection seems
to me to be this: “If he whom I baptized is
drawing all men unto him and is conferring on
them spiritual gifts greater than I conferred, it
is because his spiritual power, heaven bestowed,
is greater. For, in the spiritual realm no man

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
can usurp; no man can receive what heaven
does not give.” In other words, spiritual results
are always an all-sufficient justification for any
spiritual work. No question of its regularity, or
of the authority or the right of the worker is to
be entertained.—&#8203;<b>Ye yourselves bear me out.</b>
He turns their words, “to whom thou barest
witness,” against themselves. See for his witness
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 3:11, 12; John

<p><b>29, 30. He that hath the bride is the
bridegroom</b>, etc. In the East, etiquette forbids
any meetings between the bride and groom
prior to marriage. Often they do not even see
each other. All communications between them
are carried on by one answering to our groomsman,
and who is designated as the friend of the
bridegroom. See <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
25:1-13, <abbr title="Preliminary">Prel.</abbr> Note. To
this custom John refers. The Church is the
bride (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
9:15; 25:1-13; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 21:9</span>); in a sense every
individual Christian is the bride
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Jeremiah">Jer.</abbr>
3:14; <abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 54:5</span>);
Christ is the bridegroom; every one who brings
Christ to his Church, or to the individual soul, is
a “friend of the bridegroom.” The practical
lesson for us is that we are to rejoice to be lost in
the Master; to rejoice when our mission is ended
for the Church or the individual, and those whom
we have been teaching are able to say to us, as
the Samaritans to the woman (<span class="muchsmaller">John
<a href="#ch4_42">4:42</a></span>), “Now
we believe, not because of thy saying; for we
have heard him ourselves, and know that it is
indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.”
“I know scarcely any words in all the Scriptures
which have a deeper and diviner music in them
than these, or which more express all that a
Christian minister and a Christian man should
wish to understand and feel; and should hope

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
that some day he may understand and feel as he
who first spoke them did.”—(<cite>Maurice.</cite>)—<b>Who
standeth and heareth him.</b> Stands ready to
do the bridegroom’s bidding.—&#8203;<b>He must increase,
but I must decrease.</b> This is with
John the Baptist a subject not for resignation,
but for rejoicing. His decrease in the increasing
of Christ is the evidence that his work and his
faith have not been in vain. For him to live is
Christ; hence the more Christ and the less John,
the greater his joy.</p>

<p><b>31-32.</b> It has been supposed by some critics
that the discourse of John the Baptist ends with
the preceding verse, and that what follows is
a comment by the Evangelist, (so Bengel, Olshausen,
Tholuck); and by others that although
it is in form the Evangelist’s report of the Baptist’s
words, it has been so transformed in the
reporting that it is in effect the Evangelist’s,
(so Lucke and De Wette.) It must be confessed
that the style is far more like that of John the
Evangelist than like that of John the Baptist, so
far as we have reports from other quarters, of
the latter’s discourses; but there is no indication
of any transition here from a report to a
comment on it; and the closeness of the connection
in thought forbids the idea that any such
transition exists. I therefore (with Alford and
Meyer) regard the whole discourse as in substance
that of John the Baptist, though probably
in phraseology largely that of the Evangelist.—&#8203;<b>He
that cometh from above is above all.</b>
The Baptist emphasizes the contrast between
Christ and himself. Christ, from above and
above all, speaks what he knows and has seen
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
John <a href="#ch3_11">3:11</a></span>); John the Baptist from the earth,
and possessing the earthly nature, can, like all
other human teachers, only declare the truth as
it has come to him in his earthly condition and
as seen through the earthly atmosphere. The
teachings of Christ are the highest even in the
Bible, for they are free from that admixture of
earthiness which belongs essentially to all mere
earth-born teachers.—&#8203;<b>No man receiveth his
testimony.</b> A sorrowful comment (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>

by <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:14; and 2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 3:2. A pregnant
and suggestive metaphor; that we put the
seal to God’s testimony.—&#8203;<b>He whom God hath
sent.</b> The question of Christ’s relation to the
Father is not in issue here. John’s disciples complain
that Jesus teaches at all; John replies that
the divine effects of his teaching are the attestation
of his divine ministry; and that having been
divinely sent, he can speak no other than divine
words. Compare <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch7_16">7:16</a>.—&#8203;<b>For the Father
giveth not the Spirit by measure.</b> Alford
sustains the addition of the English translators,
<em>unto him</em>; to me it seems, as to Meyer, quite arbitrary.
The meaning is not, God has distinguished
Christ from all other teachers by his
unmeasured gifts of grace to him; but, when
God gives he does not stint, nor measure, nor
parley, but gives abundantly more than we can
ask or think (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 3:20</span>); therefore, when he
sends one into the world to reveal divine truth,
we are not to be afraid of his teaching, and to put
limitations upon and hindrances about him, lest
he go astray. The truth that God has given immeasurably
more into the hands of his only begotten
Son than to any created being appears in the
next verse, not in this. Our English version destroys
the climax, and makes <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>

than a repetition of <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch3_34">34</a>.—&#8203;<b>And hath given

throughout the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> the power and authority of

not as original or independent of him. See for

<p>This interview between Christ and the Samaritan

of that is uncertain.
With Ellicott and Andrews, I think December
of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 27 the most probable date. Matthew
(<span class="muchsmaller">4:12</span>) explains Christ’s departure into Galilee by
saying that it took place when he heard that
John the Baptist was cast into prison; John here
attributes it to another cause, a fear of rivalry
and contention between his own and John’s disciples.
The probable explanation is that Christ
left Judea for the latter reason, but did not commence
his public ministry till the imprisonment
of the Baptist. See <a href="#CHAPTER_V"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 5</a>,

<p><b>1-4. Jesus made and baptized more disciples
than John.</b> The conversation between
Christ and Nicodemus took place at the Passover,
and therefore in the spring; if that between
Christ and the woman at the well occurred in
December, Jesus and John the Baptist baptized
together during the summer. The doctrine
which Christ preached at this time was substantially
the same as that of the Baptist. “Repent,
for the kingdom of heaven is at hand”
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
3:2; 4:17</span>); for he had not yet begun to explain
publicly the spiritual and universal nature of his
kingdom. But differences between the ministries
of the two were from the first apparent; differences
chiefly respecting the ceremonials of <span style="white-space:nowrap;">religion—purifying,</span>
baptizing, fasting (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch3_25">3:25</a>, <a href="#ch3_26">26</a>;
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 9:14</span>). The increasing popularity of Christ
threatened to awake the envy of the Baptist’s
disciples, his disregard of ceremonial to awaken
their suspicion; the Pharisees were alert to stimulate
both. So Christ withdrew, forestalling the
first danger of rupture and conflict, a lesson to all
Christian workers against all unchristian rivalries
and contentions about details in doctrine or
ceremony. Envy is the most common instigator
of denominational controversy.—&#8203;<b>Jesus himself
baptized not.</b> No instance is recorded of
any baptism administered by Christ, or of any
baptism commanded or authorized by Christ, till
after his resurrection and about the time of his
ascension. Baptism appears to have been adopted
by his disciples from John the Baptist, and

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
employed by them without express direction
from Christ, as a symbol of repentance and a
profession of a new life, and to have been subsequently
adopted in a modified form by their
Lord. That it was always regarded by the apostles
as subordinate to the preaching of the Word
is indicated by Acts 10:4, 8, with 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 1:16,
17, from which it appears to have been a ministerial
act not ordinarily performed by the apostles.
On the history of baptism, see note on the
baptism of Jesus by John, <abbr title="Volume One">Vol. I</abbr>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 72, and on
Christian baptism, note on <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
28:19.—&#8203;<b>And
he must needs go through Samaria.</b> Simply
because that province lay directly between
Judea and Galilee, and therefore on the direct
route. See map. Josephus tells us that it was
the custom of the Galileans, when they came to
the holy city to the festivals, to take their journey
through the country of the Samaritans. The
more bigoted Judeans may have sometimes
avoided it by going through Perea. The history
of Samaria explains, and in some measure justifies,
the odium attaching to it and its inhabitants
among the Jews. At the time of the secession of
the ten tribes under Rehoboam (<span class="muchsmaller">1 Kings, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 12</span>), Shechem
was adopted by him as the capital of the new
monarchy, and made the seat of an idolatrous
worship. Subsequently the city of Samaria was
built by Omri, king of Israel, as capital (<span class="muchsmaller">1 Kings
16:24</span>), and so remained till the time of the captivity
of the ten tribes under Shalmaneser (<span class="muchsmaller">2 Kings
17:6</span>). A heathen colony was then sent in to take
the places of the exiled Israelites; these colonists
suffered from the devastations of wild
beasts, and acting on the common assumption of
that time that their own gods were not competent
to take care of them in a strange land, sent
for and received priests of Israel to teach them
the manner of the God of Palestine. The result
of this instruction was a mixed religion, partly
Jewish, partly heathen (<span class="muchsmaller">2 Kings 17:24-41</span>). In the
<abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>, the phrase “the cities of Samaria,” is
equivalent to the “kingdom of Israel;” it thus
included all of Palestine north of Judea. That
portion of Israel east of the Jordan which originally
belonged to it was subsequently taken away
the kings of Assyria (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Chronicles">Chron.</abbr> 5:26</span>), Galilee
shared the same fate (<span class="muchsmaller">2 Kings 15:29</span>), and Samaria
was reduced to the dimensions which it possessed
in the time of Christ. The character and conduct
of the Samaritans increased the antagonism
between them and the Jews. They were refused
permission to participate in the rebuilding of the
temple at Jerusalem, at the time of the return
of Judah from captivity, and became open, and,
for a time, successful opponents of the rebuilding
(<span class="muchsmaller">Ezra, <abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr> 4 and 5; <abbr title="Nehemiah">Neh.</abbr>, <abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr> 4 and 6</span>). Finally, an
exiled priest from Jerusalem obtained permission
from the Persian king of his day to build a rival
temple at Gerizim, and Samaria became the rival
of Jerusalem, and the rallying-point of its foes
and its outlaws (<span class="muchsmaller">Josephus’ <abbr title="Antiquities">Antiq.</abbr> 11:8, 6</span>). To a rival
temple and religion, they added a Samaritan
Pentateuch, for which they claimed a greater
antiquity and authority than for any copy of the
<abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> possessed by the Jews. The bitter national
and religious antipathy between Jew and Samaritan,
consequent upon this history, is illustrated
in several passages in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch4_9">9</a>, note; <a href="#ch8_48">8:48</a>;
Luke 9:52-56; 10:30-37; 17:16</span>). If anything could justify
such an antipathy this would be justified,
since the Samaritans were renegades both to their
religion and to their nation; and Christ’s course
here and elsewhere implies a condemnation of all
rancor and bitterness, founded on race, national,
or religious differences. Of the Samaritans, one
hundred and fifty still worshipping in a little
synagogue at the foot of Gerizim are all that are
left, “the oldest and the smallest sect in the
world.”</p>

<p><b>5. A city of Samaria called Sychar.</b> The
prevalent opinion is that Sychar is a corruption
of the name Shechem, that it means <dfn>drunken</dfn>,
and that this slight change was given by the Jews
to the rival capital in derision, and in possible
allusion to Isaiah 28:1. If this be so, it must
have become current at this time; for we can
hardly believe that John would otherwise embody
a mere term of derision in the Evangelical narrative.
Dr. Thomson (<cite>Land and Book</cite>, <abbr title="two">ii</abbr>:206, following
Hug, Luthardt, and Ewald) identifies the
ancient Sychar with a village about half a mile
north of the supposed site of Jacob’s well, called
Aschar; and as the corruption of Shechem into
Sychar is a mere hypothesis, framed to account
for the use of the word here, Dr. Thomson’s
opinion appears to me the more probable. Shechem
was two miles distant from Jacob’s well,
and apparently was abundantly supplied with
water.</p>

</div>

<p><b>6. Now Jacob’s spring was there.</b> There
are two Greek words translated <dfn>well</dfn> in this narrative:
the first means a spring or fountain, <i>i. e.</i>,
water-source; the second a well or cistern, <i>i. e.</i>, a
water-chamber. The first (<span lang="el">πηγή</span>) is used here,
indicating that the well was fed internally by
springs, not externally by rain. A well, now dry
and deserted, answering to all the conditions of

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
the narrative here, is designated by an ancient
tradition as the one here described; and the case
is one of the very few in Palestine in which tradition
appears to be trustworthy. It is accepted
even by Dr. Robinson. The purchase of the
ground by Jacob is described in <abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 33:18-20,
but for the digging of the well there is no other
authority than tradition, unless <abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 49:22 is an
allusion to it. Whether Jacob himself dug it, or
whether his name was subsequently given to it
by tradition is not known, nor does the reference
here determine that question; it only designates
the well by its customary name. Why he should
have dug a well at all has been made matter of
question, since the whole valley abounds with
water. To this question Dr. Thomson replies:
“The well is a
very <em>positive</em> fact,
and it must have
been dug by
somebody, notwithstanding
this
abundance of
fountains, and
why not by Jacob?”
And he
suggests that
these fountains
may have been
already appropriated
by the native
population. The
site of the well
is in the valley
between Mts. Gerizim
and Ebal.
For a striking description
of this
valley, see Van
der Velde. The historical associations connected
with the site were many and sacred. There the
Lord first appeared to Abraham (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 12:6, 7</span>); Jacob
built his first altar (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 33:18-20</span>); Joseph sought his
brethren in vain (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 37:12</span>); Joshua rehearsed the
law, with its blessings and cursings, and amidst the
loud amens of the assembled people (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Joshua">Josh.</abbr> 8:30-35;
24:1-25</span>); and there Joseph was buried in the land
that belonged to his father Jacob (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Joshua">Josh.</abbr> 24:32</span>).
“At no other spot in Palestine, probably, could
Jesus have more fitly uttered his remarkable
doctrine, of the absolute liberty of conscience
from all thrall of place or tradition, than here in
Shechem, where the whole Jewish nation, in a
peculiar sense, had its beginning.”—(<cite>H. W.
Beecher’s Life of Christ.</cite>)—<b>Being wearied with
his journey.</b> The commentators call attention
to this weariness as an evidence of the reality of
his humanity. It seems to me, when coupled
with the prophecy of Isaiah 53:2, his apparent
sinking under the weight of the cross, and his
early death, while the two thieves survived
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
27:32; Mark 15:44; John <a href="#ch19_32">19:32</a>,
<a href="#ch19_33">33</a></span>), to be an indication
that his physical frame was not robust,
was not equal to the demands of the soul which it
contained, and that, as a part of his human experience,
he knew the peculiar sorrows which an
intense and active mind feels when hindered by a
weak bodily organization.—&#8203;<b>Sat thus at the
spring.</b> “What meaneth ‘thus’? Not upon a
throne; not upon a cushion; but simply and as
he was upon the ground.”—(<cite>Chrysostom.</cite>)—<b>And
it was about the sixth hour.</b> That is, about
twelve o’clock. There appears to be no adequate
reason for the opinion that has been advanced,
that John employs a different kind of reckoning
from that common among the Jews, and means
here 6 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> It
is true that the
evening was the
common hour of
resort to the wells
by the women,
but evidently this
conference was
with Christ <em>alone</em>,
an indication that
the hour was not
the evening hour,
for then others
would probably
have been present
also. Ryle suggests
that there
is a significance
in the fact that
while Christ
talked with Nicodemus
alone, and
at night, his ministry
to this sinful woman was at a public resort,
and at noon. “If a man will try to do good
to a person like the Samaritan woman, alone and
without witnesses, let him take heed that he
walk in his Master’s footsteps, as to the time of
his proceedings, as well as to the message he delivers.”

Gospel message to the woman that was a sinner
(<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 7:37, etc.</span>).</p>

East the towns are not supplied, as with us, by
means of aqueducts and water-pipes, nor are individual
houses furnished each with its well.
The well itself is usually excavated from the solid
limestone rock, and provided with a low curb to
guard against accident (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> 21:33</span>). On such a
curb Christ probably sat to rest. The well is
ordinarily not furnished with any apparatus for
drawing water. Each woman brings her own
bucket, most commonly made of the skin of some

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
animal; sometimes the well is shallow, and she
descends by steps made for the purpose (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 24:16</span>),
and dips the water up from the surface; if it is
deep, she lets down her bucket with a rope. To
assist in the work, a wheel or pulley is sometimes
fixed over the well. A trough of wood or stone
usually provides a means for watering cattle and
sheep (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 24:20; <abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> 2:16</span>). In this case, Christ
had no bucket with him, and the well being deep,
so that he could not descend into it, he had no
means of obtaining water (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>

insignificant a request he makes the occasion for
a deeply spiritual religious conversation; and
how natural the transition from the material to
the spiritual. Observe, too, that by asking a
favor he opens the way to the granting of one.
He thus verifies the truth that the way to gain
another’s good will is not at first by <em>doing</em>, but by
<em>receiving</em> a kindness.—&#8203;<b>His disciples were gone

<p><b>10. If thou knewest the gift of God.</b>
Not, If thou knew that water is the gift of God;
this knowledge might indeed have prevented her
seemingly surly refusal, but it would not have led
her to ask living water of him. Nor, If thou
knewest the peace and joy which are the spiritual
gifts of God; these constitute the living water,
and if she already knew them, in her experience,
she would not need to ask to <em>receive</em> them. Christ
is the unspeakable gift of God; if she knew the
full importance of this gift, the office and work
of the Messiah, and that he who was asking her
for a drink of water was he, she would have
asked and received from him living water. The
objection that the woman would not have so
comprehended the reference, and therefore that
it cannot be the primary meaning (<cite>Alford</cite>, <cite>Meyer</cite>),
is not tenable, because by the very language itself
it is implied that the woman will not comprehend
it. Christ speaks of a mystery to provoke her to
further inquiry.—&#8203;<b>Living water.</b> This phrase
signifies primarily spring water, as opposed to
water in a cistern. In <abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 26:19;
<abbr title="Leviticus">Lev.</abbr> 14:5;
<abbr title="Jeremiah">Jer.</abbr> 2:13, the word rendered “springing,” “running,”
and “living,” is in the Septuagint the one
here rendered “living.” It is taken by Christ as
a symbol of the spiritual life which he imparts,
and so as a symbol of himself, for he gives himself
to the soul, and is, by his indwelling, the
bread and water of life. The spiritual meaning
then is not <em>life-giving</em>; for that a different Greek
word would be employed (<span lang="el">ζωοποιών</span> not <span lang="el">ζῶν</span>).
It is true that living water is life-giving, but that
is not the meaning conveyed by the phrase. The
meaning is water that has life in itself, as in John
<a href="#ch6_51">6:51</a>; “living bread” means the living Christ, in
contrast with the inert manna. The significance
of the metaphor here is explained by its connection.
Christ compares himself with water, not
because of its cleansing power, nor because of
its revivifying power on the soil, but because he
satisfies the soul’s thirst. A similar metaphorical
use of water is to be found in the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> See
Psalm 23:2; Isaiah 55:1; <abbr title="Jeremiah">Jer.</abbr> 2:13; but especially
<abbr title="Numbers">Numb.</abbr> 20:8-11, an incident which it appears
to me probable Christ had in mind, and one
with which the woman was probably familiar, as
the Samaritans accepted and employed the Pentateuch.
Observe that salvation is the gift of
God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 6:23</span>), and that the only condition of receiving
it is asking (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:6; 7:7; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 22:17</span>). The
water’ is always ready; it is the thirst only that
is wanting (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 14:17-19</span>).</p>

their origin back to the patriarchs, and her
language here implies a claim to an ancestry
superior to that of the Jews, among whom she
classed Jesus. Observe an illustration of the
spirit which says, What sufficed for our fathers
is good enough for us, no one can be greater
than they; a spirit which is fatal to all progress,
in either material or spiritual things.</p>

<p><b>13, 14. Every one drinking of this
water</b>; accustomed to drink of it, and relying
upon it. “The ‘drinking’ sets forth the recurrence,
the interrupted seasons of the drinking
of earthly water.”—(<cite>Alford.</cite>)—<b>Shall thirst
again.</b> He appeals in this to the woman’s
experience, who comes daily to re-supply the
ever-recurring want.—&#8203;<b>But whosoever has
drunk</b>; once for all; the tense (aorist, <span lang="el">πίῃ</span>)
indicates an historical act once performed.—&#8203;<b>That
I shall give to him.</b> Observe the
representation throughout that the water is a
gift, and a gift not <em>received</em> by Christ in common
with humanity, but <em>given</em> by Christ to humanity.
The Bible may be searched in vain for similar
language from any prophet or apostle.—&#8203;<b>Shall
not thirst unto eternity.</b> That is, shall
never, even unto eternity, thirst. “The whole
verse is a strong argument in favor of the
doctrine of the perpetuity of grace, and the
consequent perseverance and the faith of believers.”—(<cite>Ryle.</cite>)
<abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch10_28">10:28</a>; <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:35-39;
2 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 1:12.—&#8203;<b>But the water which
I shall give him.</b> This Christ does by giving
his own life for the life of the world in his
sacrifice for sin (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch6_51">6:51</a></span>) and in his spiritual
indwelling in the soul of the believer
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_19">14:19</a>, <a href="#ch14_23">23</a></span>).—&#8203;<b>Shall
become in him a fountain of
water.</b> Not a <em>well</em> (not <span lang="el">φρέαρ</span> but <span lang="el">πηγή</span>). The
reason he shall never thirst is that the water
which Christ gives becomes itself a water
source, a spring, a perpetual fountain of
supply.—&#8203;<b>Springing up unto eternal life.</b>
Not <em>into</em>; the preposition indicates not something
into which the fountain will be transformed,
but the duration of its existence; it
will forever spring up in the soul. The contrast
throughout these verses is between earthly and
spiritual supplies. The <dfn>well</dfn> (<span lang="el">φρέαρ</span>) is a symbol
of earthly supply. This appeases but never
satisfies; for it furnishes that which is external,
and which is consumed in the using, so that
the soul which relies on earthly cisterns for its
satisfaction thirsts again. The living water, the
spring (<span lang="el">πηγή</span>) which Christ gives, becomes a
fountain in the soul, it enters into and becomes
part of the character; using does not consume
but increases the supply. In Christ’s promise
here thirst is not equivalent to “desire,” nor is
the declaration “shall never thirst,” equivalent
to “shall never feel any spiritual want.” Thirst
is of all bodily cravings the most painful and
intolerable. Hence it is used in the Bible as a
metaphor, not merely of spiritual <em>desires</em>, but of
an urgent and intense desire, that cannot be
denied (<span class="muchsmaller">Psalm 42:2; 63:1;
143:6; Isaiah 55:1; <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:6,
note</span>). Here then the declaration is that Christ
satisfies this painful longing, so that the soul
shall experience it no more. Of soul-thirst we
have striking illustrations in Psalms 41 and 42,
and in <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 7:17-24;
of soul-satisfaction in
Christ, illustrations in Psalm 46 and in
<abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:31-39.
Compare Christ’s promises in John <a href="#ch11_36">11:36</a>;
<a href="#ch16_32">16:32</a>, <a href="#ch6_32">33</a>. The continuance of earnest
spiritual desires is not inconsistent with a rich
spiritual experience. See <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 3:12-14.</p>

<p><b>15.</b> There is certainly a difference in tone
between this request and the answer of verses
<a href="#ch4_11">11</a>, <a href="#ch4_13">13</a>.
The woman now dimly recognizes and
vaguely appreciates Christ’s interpretation of
her own soul-want, and replies half in jest, half
in earnest. But her language “neither come
hither to draw,” shows that she still gives to
Christ’s words, as I think purposely misinterpreting
them, a prosaic and literal meaning.
Observe the implied misapprehension of the
office of Christ, as one who relieves the soul of
all further care and labor in the matter of
religion. “There are many like her who would
be glad of such a divine gift of religion as should
take away all the labor and trouble of Christian
life. ‘That I come not hither to draw’ is the
desire of thousands who want the results of
right living without the trouble of living
aright.”—(<cite>H. W. Beecher.</cite>)</p>


<div class="p2 blockquote">

<p class="hanging">16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and

</div>

<p><b>16. Go, call thy husband</b>, etc. This is
in appearance a break in the conversation; it is
in reality the first step toward granting the
woman’s request: “Give me this water;” for
the first step is to convince of sin. It is only if
we confess our sins that “He is faithful and just
to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
all unrighteousness” (<span class="muchsmaller">1 John 1:9</span>). Hence when
Christ came to bring this water of life to the
world he began by preaching the duty of repentance
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 4:17; Mark 1:15</span>). Other explanations, as
that a longer conversation with the woman alone
would be indecorous (<cite>Grotius</cite>), or that she was
unable to understand Christ’s meaning and so he
summoned her husband (<cite>Cyril</cite>, quoted in <cite>Alford</cite>),
or that he wished her husband to share with her
in the benefits of the conversation (<cite>Chrysostom</cite>),
singularly ignore the moral meaning and continuity
of the discourse. Observe Christ’s uniform
way of dealing with skepticism. Its root is in
sin; and he addresses not the reason, but
proceeds directly to convict the conscience. It
is only the sinner, conscious of sin, who ever
truly finds a divine Saviour.</p>

and I see no reason to doubt that she had lived
with five successive husbands.—&#8203;From these she
had been separated, from some perhaps by death,
from others by divorce; at all events the last
of these separations was unconcealedly illegal,
and her present life was one which her own
conscience condemned as licentious. Observe
the severity in fact and the gentleness in form
of Christ’s rebuke. It shows a full knowledge
of her sin; yet it is couched in the language not
of condemnation but of commendation.</p>

<p><b>19, 20. The woman saith unto him.</b>
Her sentence is incomplete, either in the utterance
or in the report. It is the basis of a
question, implied, or perhaps expressed, but
not given by John, in which place should
worship be offered; which were right, Jew or
Samaritan. The question was one fiercely
debated between them (<span class="muchsmaller">See
on verse <a href="#ch4_5">5</a></span>).—&#8203;<b>I perceive
that thou art a prophet.</b> It was a
hasty conclusion; Christ might have known her
character and life by other than supernatural
means. Bigotry and vice are apt to be credulous
and superstitious. Observe, however, the difference
in tone between this declaration and the
language of verse <a href="#ch4_9">9</a>: “How is it that thou
being a Jew.”—&#8203;<b>Our fathers worshipped.</b>
“The argument of ‘our fathers’ has always
proved strong. Opinions, like electricity, are
supposed to descend more safely along an
unbroken chain. That which ‘our fathers’ or
our ancestors believed, is apt to seem necessarily
true; and the larger the roots of any belief, the
more flourishing, it is supposed, will be its top.”—(<cite>Beecher.</cite>)
Calvin’s comments are admirable
though too long to quote. He suggests four
errors into which men are apt to fall, from
blindly following the “<em>fathers</em>,” all illustrated
by the Samaritans: (1) When pride has created
a false custom or religion, the history of the
fathers is ransacked to find justification for it;
(2) when men imitate the example of the evil-doers,
because they are ancient, forgetful that
they only are worthy to be reckoned as fathers
who are true sons of God; (3) when we imitate
the conduct but not the spirit of the fathers, as
if one should defend human sacrifice from the
example of Abraham in <abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 22:1-10; (4) when
we imitate the conduct of the fathers without
considering the change of circumstances, as
when the Christian church attempts to copy the
ceremonials of the Jewish. “None of these are
true imitators of the fathers; most of them are
apes.”—<b>In this mount</b>, Gerizim. According
to the Samaritan tradition it was here that
Abraham went to sacrifice Isaac; and here, not
on Ebal, as according to our Scripture (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Joshua">Josh.</abbr> 8:30;
<abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> 27:4</span>), that the altar was erected by Joshua
on which the words of the law were inscribed.
The first view is sanctioned by some Christian
scholars, prominent among whom is Dean Stanley.
A temple was built on Gerizim by the
Samaritans, according to Josephus, during the
reign of Alexander, though the date is doubtful.
The two temples intensified the bitterness of the
feud between the Jews and the Samaritans, and
the Samaritan temple was deserted and destroyed,
<span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 129, by John Hyrcanus (<span class="muchsmaller">Josephus’
Antiquities 13:9, 11</span>); but the Samaritans at Sechem
(Nablus) still call Gerizim the holy mountain,
and turn their faces toward it in prayer.—&#8203;<b>Ye
say.</b> She still treats Christ as a Jew.</p>

<p>Some have regarded the question presented
by the woman here as a serious one; recognizing
Christ as a prophet, she asks his solution of what
was to her mind the great religious problem of
the day; others see in it an endeavor on her
part to evade the personal reference to her own
sins. Both seem to me true. She endeavors to
turn the conversation; recognizing the truth of
Christ’s allegation, “He whom thou now hast
is not thy husband,” not by confessing her sin
but by acknowledging him as a prophet; but
eludes the topic by opening a problem in controversial
theology. In all this she is honest

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
and in earnest. She is not the first inquirer
who has deemed theoretical theology more
important than practical duty. The moment
her thoughts are turned to religious truth, they
tend to its external aspects, and she naturally
and honestly seeks a refuge from her conscience
in the question, Where ought men to worship?
The question, What ought <em>I</em> to do? is postponed.
Observe that Christ suffers her to change the
subject; leaves her conscience to press the sin
to which he has awakened it, and teaches his
followers how to deal with those who evade
practical duty by doctrinal or ceremonial questions
by his own response, No matter <em>where</em> or
<em>how</em> the soul seeks God, if it only seeks him in
spirit and in truth.</p>

directs her thought toward the <em>person</em> to be
worshipped.—&#8203;<b>We know what we worship.</b>
This is the only instance in which Christ classes
himself with the Jews by the pronoun <em>we</em>. He
accepts, for the time, her estimate of him as a
Jewish prophet, and declares that it is in the
Jewish Scripture she is to look for a knowledge
of the true God. In fact, all correct knowledge
of the character, attributes, and dealings of God,
possessed by the world to-day, has come through
the Jewish people, by means of the Old and
New Testaments (<span class="muchsmaller">see Romans 3:1, 2; 9:4, 5</span>). At the
time of this conversation idolatry had entirely
disappeared from the Jewish nation; and
however inadequate, imperfect, and corrupt
their worship, they at least recognized the one
only true God. Notwithstanding some efforts
to prove the contrary, I think it is historically
demonstrable that Judaism is the source of all
monotheistic religion. It is reasonably certain
that the monotheism of Mohammedanism is due
to Mohammed’s early instruction in the principles
of Judaism.—&#8203;<b>For the salvation is of
the Jews.</b> The definite article in the original,
unfortunately omitted in our English version,
gives not only emphasis but significance to the
language. The Jews know what they worship,
because it is from them, as a nation, that there
comes forth the divine salvation, typified by the
sacrifices at Jerusalem, prophesied by Jewish
Scripture, and fulfilled by the Messiah born at
Bethlehem in Judea. It is therefore here equivalent
not merely to the Saviour, but also includes
all the preparations which preceded his personal
advent.—&#8203;<b>But the hour cometh and now is.</b>
The last clause is added parenthetically as a
suggestion that the woman is not to look to the
remote future for the fulfillment of this word.
Already the day has dawned, though it has not
fully arrived. Her language in verse <a href="#ch4_25">25</a> indicates
that a suspicion of Christ’s true nature was,
perhaps by this declaration, awakened in her.—&#8203;<b>When
the true worshippers.</b> Not merely
the sincere in opposition to consciously hypocritical
worshippers (<span class="muchsmaller">Isaiah 29:13</span>), but also the
true, inward worshippers, in opposition to those
whose worship was one of external form and
therefore not genuine. The word <dfn>true</dfn> is elsewhere
used thus by John to indicate the inward
and spiritual as contrasted with the external and
earthly, <i>e. g.</i>, the true light
(<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch1_9">1:9</a></span>), the true bread
(<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch6_32">6:32</a></span>),
the true vine (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch15_1">15:1</a></span>).
Compare Luke 16:11.—&#8203;<b>Shall
worship the Father</b>, and therefore
know what they worship; <b>in spirit and
in truth</b>. Not in the Holy Spirit, though it is
true that all spiritual worship is inspired and
directed by his influence (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:26; Zach. 12:10</span>); nor
with the breathing and aspirations of the heart,
in contrast to worship with outward forms and
symbols, for symbol is necessary in all public
worship, language is but an external symbol of
inward feeling; nor in holiness and righteousness
of life, for that is not the meaning of <dfn>spirit</dfn>;

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
nor in soundness of faith, in contrast to heretical
worship, for the worship of the Jews was not
heretical, Christ has just said, “We know what
we worship.” <dfn>In</dfn> (<span lang="el">ἐν</span>) expresses not the instrument
with which the worship shall be conducted,
but the atmosphere in which it will live, an
atmosphere of spiritual life and truth; worship
<em>in spirit</em>, is in contrast with a worship in the
flesh, the essence of which consists in the rite,
the form, the language, the posture (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr>
12:1; <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 3:3, 4; <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 9:9, 24</span>); worship <em>in truth</em> is
one which in its character harmonizes with the
nature of him who is worshipped. The Lycaonians
would have worshipped Paul and Barnabas
(<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 14:11-13</span>) in sincerity, but not in truth.
Christ’s language condemns the spirit of ritualism,
but not the employment of rites.—&#8203;<b>For
the Father is seeking such to worship
him.</b> God is represented as in quest of such
worshippers, among the many who are worshippers
merely in form. Observe <em>work is not</em> worship;
God is seeking not merely workers (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 20:1</span>)
but also worshippers (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> Luke 10:38-42, notes</span>).—&#8203;<b>God
is a Spirit.</b> This declaration is fundamental,
and radically inconsistent with (1) all
scientific theories which represent him as an
abstract impersonal force; (2) with all metaphysical
refinements which, ignoring his personality,
treat him as a “power that makes for
righteousness,” or as “the highest dream of
which the human soul is capable;” (3) with
much of the received theology, which often
assumes that God is like nature, and deduces
his attributes from such an imaginary likeness;
(4) with all idolatry, whether the idol be in the
imagination or in wood, stone, or canvas. But
it justifies us in looking to man’s spiritual nature
to interpret the divine nature to us. The spirituality
of God is abundantly taught in the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>,
but by implication only. The abstract statement
occurs only here and in 2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr>
3:17.—&#8203;<b>Must
worship him in spirit and in truth.</b> Nothing
else is worship.</p>

<p>Observe (1) Christ answers the woman’s question
not by pointing out the right place of worship,
but by inculcating such a conception of the
true nature of worship, that the controversy
respecting Gerizim and Jerusalem shrinks into
insignificance. The solution of many theological
problems is to be found, not in any answer,
but in a new, a higher, a more spiritual conception
of religion as a spiritual life. (2) The place,
and impliedly the forms and methods of worship,
are matters of no importance. (3) It is important
that we know what we worship, <i>i. e.</i>, that
our worship be intelligent, else it is superstitious.
“Unless there be knowledge, it is not God that
we worship, but a phantom or idol.”—(<cite>Calvin.</cite>)
(4) That knowledge includes three elements, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>,
that God is a <em>spiritual being</em>, with the sympathies,
the flexibility, the <em>life</em> which belongs to spirit;
that he is a Father, and is therefore to be approached
with a filial, reverential, trusting affection
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:9, note</span>); that he is revealed to us
through the Jewish Scripture and the Jewish
Messiah. (5) He must be worshipped in spirit,
<i>i. e.</i>, with the heart, and in truth, <i>i. e.</i>, in accordance
with the realities of his nature as thus revealed
to us; nothing else is worship. (6) Worship
is essential to a religious life. God looks for
it, as well as for work, as an evidence of love.
The whole lesson is eloquently embodied by
Henry Ward Beecher in his <cite>Life of Christ</cite>: “It
expresses the renunciation of the senses in worship.
It throws back upon the heart and soul of
every one, whoever he may be, wherever he may
be, the whole office of worship. It is the first
gleam of the new morning. No longer in this
nest alone, or in that, shall religion be looked for,
but escaping from its shell, heard in all the earth,
in notes the same in every language, flying unrestrained
and free, the whole heavens shall be its
sphere and the whole earth its home.”</p>

<p><b>25, 26. The woman saith unto him.</b>
Chrysostom well expresses her spirit: “The
woman was made dizzy by his discourse, and
fainted at the sublimity of what he said.” So
she turns away from the present revelation, procrastinating
its application with the expectation
of a better opportunity when the Messiah comes.—&#8203;<b>He
will tell us all things</b> is not to be interpreted
literally; it is the expression of a vague
hope of a clearer light by and by.—&#8203;<b>I that speak
unto thee am he.</b> Christ did not until a much
later period declare his Messiahship to his own
disciples; he never declared it more clearly than
to this sinful Samaritan woman. There is a reason
for it, in that this declaration took from her
all excuse of procrastination, and in fact made
her a missionary of the Messiah. Perhaps, too,
the very fact that she was an uninfluential woman
and a Samaritan may have made him more ready
to reveal himself; for it was certainly his general
purpose not to disclose his character and mission
to the public until his death (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 17:9</span>). We certainly
have no right to say, with some rationalizing
critics, that because we cannot fully understand
his reasons it is incredible. Such a method
of criticism would make havoc of all history.
Most scholars suppose that the words “which is

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
called Christ” were spoken by the woman. It
seems to me more probable that they were added
by John, as an explanation to his Greek readers
of the Hebrew term Messiah. The word Christ
is its Greek equivalent.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Note on Christ as a conversationalist.</span>—&#8203;Christ
as a preacher has been studied; Christ as
a conversationalist is quite as worthy the Christian’s
study. Many of his so-called discourses
were simply conversations; this is notably the
case with the discourse to Nicodemus
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch3_1">3:1-21</a></span>)
and the discourse here to the woman of Samaria.
Observe, <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> <i>The contrast.</i> In the first the conversation
is with a religious teacher, of honorable
position, of unexceptionable life; in the second,
with an abandoned woman, of licentious life; in
the first, conversation with Christ is sought, in
the second, repelled; in the first, Christ impresses
the truth that the moralist must be born again,
and without personal trust in a personal Saviour
is condemned; in the second, he impresses upon
the outcast the truth that for the lost there is
new life in him; the first he discourages, the
second encourages; to the first he proclaims
duty, to the second he preaches deliverance.
<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> <i>The harmony.</i> Both are skeptical; both receive
his declaration with scoffs; both invite argument;
with both Christ refuses to argue; to
both he simply proclaims the truth, but without
strife or debate; with both he conquers cavilling
by patience, not by argument. <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> <i>Christ’s
method.</i> (<i>a.</i>) Though wearied, he does not neglect
the occasion and opportunity afforded to him.
(<i>b.</i>) He commences the conversation by a natural
request. (<i>c.</i>) He opens the woman’s heart by requesting
from her a favor. (<i>d.</i>) He passes, by a
natural transition, from the physical to the spiritual
world, from nature to the truth which
nature typifies. (<i>e.</i>) He presents to her not ethical,
but spiritual truth; not the simple moralities,
but the deep things of the Gospel. (<i>f.</i>) Her badinage
does not affront him, nor does he reprove
her for it, or indicate surprise, astonishment, or
even objection. (<i>g.</i>) He answers it by a direct and
unanswerable appeal to her conscience, by convicting
her of sin. (<i>h.</i>) In this, while his rebuke is
sharp, his language is courteous, the language of
commendation clothing condemnation. (<i>i.</i>) Having
once awakened her conscience, he does not
pursue the rebuke; leaving conscience to do its
work, he suffers her to change the subject. (<i>j.</i>) He
answers her theological question not by direct
response, but by asserting a principle of worship
which lifts the soul above all controversies respecting
forms and methods of worship. (<i>k.</i>) Finally,
he makes his first and fullest disclosure of
his Messiahship to this Samaritan woman, showing
himself most a Saviour to her who most
needs his salvation. <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> <i>His example.</i> It illustrates
the enthusiasm (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 10:1; <abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 4:13; 2 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr>

woman’s character except that she was a Samaritan.
What amazed them was that Christ should
descend to instruct a woman at all, and especially
a woman of Samaria. See above on <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch4_4">4</a>.—&#8203;<b>No
man said, What seekest thou?</b> One of the
many indications in the Gospel of the awe in
which these life-companions of Christ stood
toward him (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 9:32;
10:32; 16:8; Luke 8:25; John
<a href="#ch21_12">21:12</a></span>).—&#8203;<b>Left her waterpot.</b> Lightfoot supposes
in kindness, for the Lord to use; Calvin,
with greater probability, in her haste forgetting
it. In her eagerness to carry to others the news
of the Messiah, she forgets her original errand,
which was to draw water for her home.—&#8203;<b>Come

<a href="#ch1_39">1:39</a>, <a href="#ch1_46">46</a>.—&#8203;<b>Which
told me all things that ever I did.</b> The
natural exaggeration of enthusiasm. Observe
the method of the spread of Christianity in its
earliest years. The new convert became a missionary,
propagating its faith. Compare Acts
8:4; 9:20. If ever a new convert might be
excused from evangelical labors, this one might—a
woman, living in an age when female preaching
was more obnoxious even than now, and a woman
of such ill-repute that she might well expect to
be received with scorn, not with respect. But
her strong convictions overbear all obstacles, secure
for her a hearing, and obtain for her mission
success (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch4_39">39</a></span>). Chrysostom dwells upon her
wisdom as well as her eagerness: “She said not,
Come, see the Christ, but, with the same condescension
with which Christ had netted her, she
draws the men to Him; Come, she saith, see a
man who told me all that ever I did. Is not
this the Christ? Observe again here the great
wisdom of the woman; she neither declared the
fact plainly, nor was she silent; for she desired
not to bring them in by her own assertion, but to
make them to share in this opinion by hearing

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
him. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Nor did she say, Come, believe, but
Come, <em>see</em>, a gentler expression than the other,
and one which more attracted them.”—&#8203;<b>Then
they came out of the city.</b> Wisdom and tact
inspired by enthusiasm produced by a personal
and profound conviction of Christ’s person and
power, rarely fail in evangelical labor.</p>

interpretation not required by and not really
accordant with a correct reading of <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch4_34">34</a> below
(see note there); inconsistent with other teachings
of Scripture, and practically misleading to
the disciple. It is inconsistent with the metaphor;
for in nature work is never a substitute for
food, but physiologically exhausts it. It is inconsistent
with other teachings of Scripture,
which never represent <em>work</em>, but always divine
sustaining grace, as the Christian food. It is practically
misleading, for it leads the disciple to suppose
that he can grow by simply doing the will of
his Father, whereas he is to acquire the power to
do that will by constantly receiving grace from
the Father. Christ’s language here is interpreted
by such passages as <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 4:4, “Man
shall not live by bread alone, but by every word
that proceedeth out of the mouth of God;”
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 25:4, “The wise took oil in their vessels
with their lamps.” Compare John, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">6</a>. That
Jesus lived by this divine food is evident from
his habit of prayer, and from such declarations
as John <a href="#ch5_19">5:19</a>, <a href="#ch5_26">26</a>,
<a href="#ch5_30">30</a>; <a href="#ch14_10">14:10</a>,
<a href="#ch14_11">11</a>. This meat
then is the indwelling Spirit of God, conditioned
upon entire consecration to God. It was this
meat which fed Peter in prison (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 12:6</span>), Paul
and Silas at Philippi (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 16:25</span>), and Paul in the
shipwreck (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 27:23, etc.</span>); this too which sustained
Christ in the hour of Gethsemane and
throughout his Passion. A faint type of it is
afforded in earthly experiences by the strength
which seems often to be imparted to even a
feeble mother in the hour of her child’s sickness,
and which carries her through vigils which, but
for her love, it would be impossible for her to
sustain. Her work is not her food: her love
and faith are her food, and sustain her for her
work. No Christian can live by or on his work;
nor did Christ.—&#8203;<b>Hath any one brought him
aught to eat.</b> They thought, perhaps, that the
woman had done so. “It is very characteristic
of the first part of this Gospel to bring forward
instances of unreceptivity to spiritual meaning.

The above is a literal translation of the original;

accomplishment of his mission; for this purpose
alone had meat any value to him; for this purpose
he both needed and possessed meat that his
disciples, in their then state of spiritual culture,
did not and could not understand; and in the
work which he had accomplished, by his conversation
with the woman, he had received greater
satisfaction than in any food which they could

<p><b>35.</b> There is some uncertainty regarding the
proper interpretation of this verse. Alford, Tholuck,
De Wette, and some others, suppose that
Christ is quoting a proverbial expression; perhaps
referring to the time which elapsed between
seed-time and harvest, perhaps to some time intervening
between a local feast or a religious
anniversary and the harvest. Meyer, Andrews,
Ellicott, and others take it as a chronological indication
that it was then four months to harvest,
<i>i. e.</i>, the month of December, a fact to which
perhaps some reference had been made by the
disciples in the course of their walk. Chrysostom,
Meyer, and others, suppose moreover that
the approaching Samaritans were seen through
the corn-fields, and to them Christ pointed when
he said, “Lift up your eyes and look on the
fields.” “The approaching townspeople now
showed how greatly the doing of the Father’s
will was in process of accomplishment. They
were coming through the corn-field, now tinged
with green; thus they make the fields, which for
four months would not yield the harvest, in a
higher sense already white harvest fields. Jesus
directs the attention of his disciples to this; and

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
with the beautiful picture thus presented in nature
he connects further appropriate instructions.”—(<cite>Meyer.</cite>)
The phrase “Say not ye”
seems to me clearly to indicate that Christ refers
to some proverbial saying (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 16:2</span>); the
direction, “Lift up your eyes and look on the
fields,” indicates some present appearance which
gave point to his declaration that they were
white already, a declaration which would have
no significance if the fields were literally ready
for the harvest. I therefore, with Tholuck, combine
the two views and suppose that Christ did
refer to a proverbial expression, probably indicating
the time between seed-time and harvest,
and appropriate then because it was then the
seed-time. The spiritual meaning is very clear.
Procrastination is a fault of the church as well as
of the world, of the disciple as well as of the impenitent
sinner. The Christian is constantly waiting
for an opportunity; he should wait <em>on</em>, he
never need wait <em>for</em> the Lord. Since Christ has
ascended, and the Holy Ghost has been given,
the field is always white for the harvest; we
never need wait for God to ripen the grain. The

<p><b>36-38. And he that reapeth receiveth
wages and gathereth fruit unto life eternal.</b>
The Lord’s husbandman has both wages
and heaven. The earthly wages of the successful
evangelist is not in his salary, nor in his fame
or position, but in the affections which reward
him, and the personal present consciousness of
work achieved, the highest and grandest which
it is ever permitted man to do. To this is added
the joy inherent in bringing souls to Christ, and
through Christ into eternal life, a joy which will
not be consummated until the reaper enters into
glory, with an “abundant entrance,” and brings
his sheaves to his Lord.—&#8203;<b>That both *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* may
rejoice together.</b> The sowing is in tears; the
reaping is with rejoicing (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 126:5</span>); but in the
future life both will rejoice in the ingathering;
hearts that knew not whence they received the
seed will learn to thank the unknown or the unrecognized
benefactor; and the Lord of the harvest
will say to both, “Well done, good and
faithful servants.”—&#8203;<b>Herein is that saying
true.</b> Undoubtedly a reference to a proverbial
saying, to which Christ gives a new and spiritual
significance. Primarily, Christ is the sower, who
sowed in tears and reaped but little; the apostles
are the reapers, who gathered in a single day
more souls into the church of Christ than Jesus

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
himself in his whole lifetime.—&#8203;But secondarily
the prophets were sowers and the apostles reapers,
a fact illustrated by their constantly quoting
of the prophets in attestation of the divine character
and mission of Christ. And finally, the
twofold work of sowing and reaping goes on
throughout all time, the same man sometimes
being both sower and reaper, sometimes sowing
all his life in tears that another may reap in joy.
The truth of Christ’s saying in verses 37, 38, is
illustrated, but as a prophecy it is not fulfilled,
by the successful mission of the apostles to Samaria,
where Christ sowed at this time and they
reaped subsequently (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 8:5-8, 14-17</span>).</p>

<p><b>39-42.</b> This mission of Christ to the Samaritans
is not inconsistent with his directions to his
apostles, when they were commissioned, not to
go into any Samaritan city, for the reason of that
prohibition was not his unwillingness to open the
Gospel to the heathen, but the fact that his
apostles did not yet comprehend its catholicity,
and could not therefore successfully preach it to
the heathen. That the opening of the doors to
others than Jews was neither an afterthought
with Christ, nor a supplemental act originating
with Paul, is evident from the incident recorded
here. Notice that the faith of the Samaritans
rested on Christ’s <span style="white-space:nowrap;">words—he</span> apparently wrought
no miracles; and that they recognized in him
the Saviour not of the nation but of the <em>world</em>.
“Universalism was more akin to the Messianic
faith of the Samaritans than to that of the Jews,
with their definite and energetic feeling of
nationality.”—(<cite>Meyer.</cite>) Notice too, the forms
of Christian experience illustrated in this passage;
one (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>

others, the other (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>

<p><b>43-45. After two days.</b> Spent in preaching
the gospel to the Samaritans. The nature
of this ministry is left to conjecture. We must
presume, however, that it was of the same type
as Christ’s preaching in Galilee at this time,
where his theme was, “Repent, for the kingdom
of heaven is at hand” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 4:17</span>); the nature of
that kingdom, and the character of the Messianic
king, he probably made no attempt to explain.
It was preparative; he sowed only, leaving the
reaping to be done by others at a later day.—&#8203;<b>For
Jesus himself testified that a prophet
hath no honor in his own country.</b> The
rationalistic critics cite this as one of the
evidences that the Fourth Gospel is not the
product of one of the Twelve. Thus, “In the
Synoptics Jesus is reported as quoting against
the people of his own city, Nazareth, who
rejected him, the proverb, ‘A prophet has no
honor in his own country’ (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 13:57; Mark 6:4;
Luke 4:24</span>). The appropriateness of the remark
here is obvious. The author of the Fourth
Gospel, however, shows clearly that he was
neither an eye-witness nor acquainted with the
subject or country when he introduces this
proverb in a different place. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* He
(Christ) is made to go into Galilee, which is his
own country, because a prophet has no honor in
his country, and the Galileans are represented as
receiving him, which is a contradiction of the
proverb.”—(<cite>Supernatural Religion</cite>, <abbr title="Volume Two">Vol. II</abbr>, 447.)
I have cited this objection at length because it is
a not unfair illustration of the straits to which
rationalism is reduced in its efforts to discredit
this Gospel. Constructive dogmatism is bad
enough; destructive dogmatism is much worse.
The difficulties created by evangelical critics in
the interpretation of the passage are equally
curious as an illustration of forced and fanciful
exaggerations. The curious will find them
stated in Alford and Meyer. The English
reader, who simply takes the context, will
assuredly find no difficulty in the passage.
Christ was received in Samaria, notwithstanding
he was a Jew, with whom usually the
Samaritans had no dealings (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch4_9">9</a></span>), and this
though he wrought no miracles, and merely
because of his words, <i>i. e.</i>, the purity and
beauty and self-evident truth of his teaching
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch4_41">41</a></span>).—&#8203;In Galilee he was received only
because he was a Jew, and had wrought miracles
at Jerusalem (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">chap.</abbr>
<a href="#ch3_2">3:2</a></span>), and brought with
him a metropolitan reputation. He had no
honor in his own country as a prophet, until
he brought it back with him from the holy city;
it was honor, not indigenous but imported.</p>

<p><b>48, 49. Except ye see signs and wonders.</b>
Rather a soliloquy applied to the entire
people, than a personal rebuke of the nobleman.
For there is certainly no evidence that his faith
was notably small; rather the reverse. He had
traveled twenty miles to apply to Christ for
assistance; his request that Christ should come
personally was certainly not unnatural, for he
could not be expected to assume that Christ
would or could heal by a word; when the word
was spoken he went away undoubtingly; and
he evidently made no great haste (<span class="muchsmaller">see note on verse
<a href="#ch4_51">51</a></span>), an indication of his restful assurance on
Christ’s mere word. Analogous to Christ’s
utterance here is that of Mark 9:19; see note
there. It is certainly a rebuke to the skepticism
which to-day demands signs and wonders
as a basis for faith, and to the church which
continually endeavors to satisfy this desire by
demonstrating the miracles as though they were
the evidences of Christianity. Christ himself
never, in public discourse with skeptics, based
his claims on his miracles; never performed a
miracle for the purpose of proving his claims to
an unbeliever (<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 11:4, 5 is not an exception;
see note there); and rebuked the demand made
on him for miracles as a basis of faith in his
mission.—&#8203;<b>Come down.</b> One of those geographical
and incidental evidences of accuracy

<p><b>50-54. He went his way.</b> The course of
the nobleman was not that of one deficient in
faith. On the contrary, he did not wait to
see signs or wonders; he believed the simple
word. That he did not hasten is evident from
the next verse. Christ spoke the word of healing
at the seventh hour, <i>i. e.</i>, one in the afternoon.
The father could have reached home
that same night; but it was not until the next
day that his servants, coming to relieve his fears,
met him on the road. Faith neither worries nor
hurries.—&#8203;<b>Thy son is living.</b> He was so sick
before the father left home, that the mere
announcement that he was living demonstrated
that he was recovering. The case was one in
which life could not last long if a change for
the better did not take place.—&#8203;<b>Himself believed.</b>
Believed what? He had believed
before, when he came to Jesus, or he would
not have come; and again when he went away,
or he would not have been satisfied at the mere
word of Jesus. But he before simply believed
<em>about</em> Jesus, <i>e. g.</i>, that he was a prophet, possessing
certain healing powers, the extent of which he
had not measured. Now he believed <em>on</em> Jesus;
without as yet comprehending the Saviour’s
mission or character, he yet had faith in him;
that kind of faith which was ready to accept
him as all that he claimed, whatever that might
be. To <em>believe</em>, used absolutely, as here, always
indicates not believing a doctrine about Christ,
but personal belief in and allegiance to him.</p>

<p>This miracle is certainly not the same with
the healing of the centurion’s servant, recorded
in <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 8:5-13, with which it has
been sometimes confounded, but with which it
really has little in common. One is wrought at
Capernaum, the other at Cana; one at the petition
of a nobleman, an officer of the court, the
other at the request of a centurion; one probably
for a Jew, the other certainly for a Roman;
one in behalf of a son, the other in behalf of a
servant; one for a petitioner who entreats
Christ to come to his house, the other for one
who deprecates his doing so; one affording an
illustration of the largest faith in a heathen, the
other of the development of faith from a small
beginning in an Israelite. The resemblances are
superficial; the differences are radical. Accepting
the narrative as true, it is one of the many

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
which utterly refute the rationalistic explanation
of miracles offered by such writers as Schenkel.
This cure could not have been due to any natural
means, as the inspiration of hope, or the infusion
of nervous power by personal contact, or the
like, for the sick man did not see Jesus nor even
know when the father saw him.</p>

a feast in the Fall, usually October, analogous
to our Thanksgiving. To these must be

time of Esther, from massacre (<span class="muchsmaller">Esther 9:17-19</span>), and
the feast of Dedication, instituted subsequent to
the close of the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> canon, to commemorate the
purging of the temple and the rebuilding of the
altar, after Judas Maccabeus had driven out the
Syrians, <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 164. There is nothing in the language
of John to indicate which of these various
feasts is the one here intended. Some manuscripts
have indeed the words, <em>the</em> feast of the
Jews, and if this reading were correct it would
unquestionably designate the Passover; but the
weight of authority is against it. The question
is one which has provoked a vast deal of discussion,
but no general agreement. It is important
only in determining the chronology of the life of
Christ, and is itself so far undetermined that it
cannot be of great value even for that purpose.
I think it clear (<i>a</i>) that it could not be the feast
of Dedication, which took place in the winter,
when it is not probable that the sick would be
lying in the porches of Bethesda; (<i>b</i>) nor the
feast of Purim, though this has been maintained
by some eminent modern scholars, as Wieseler,
Godet, Olshausen, Ellicott, and Meyer; for
there is no evidence that the Jews generally went
up to Jerusalem to celebrate the feast of Purim,
and no reason to believe that our Lord would

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
have gone there in honor of a festival which was
purely national, not directed by the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>,
observed not in connection with the temple
service, but privately at home, and often, if not
generally, with rioting and excess, rather than
with religious services. I agree therefore with
Alford and Tholuck that we cannot gather with
any probability what feast it was.—&#8203;<b>And Jesus
went up to Jerusalem.</b> Presumptively to
attend the feast.—&#8203;<b>By the sheep-market.</b>
Rather <dfn>sheep-gate</dfn>. See <abbr title="Nehemiah">Neh.</abbr> 3:1, 32; 12:39.
The site is unknown. The traditional site,
identical with the gate now known as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Stephen’s, is pretty effectually disproved by
Robinson, who shows that no wall was existing
there at the time of Christ.—&#8203;<b>A pool.</b> Properly
<dfn>a swimming-place</dfn>. Pools for purposes of bathing
were in use in the great cities of the old world;
and recent excavations have brought to light the
fact that ancient Jerusalem was in a remarkable
degree supplied with water. See below.—&#8203;<b>Called
Bethesda.</b> The word means <dfn>House
of mercy</dfn>. The location is entirely uncertain.
Tradition places it near the modern <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s
gate; but this tradition dates back only to the
12th century.—&#8203;<b>Having five porches.</b> Opening
upon the bath or tank. In these the sick could lie
and be partially protected from the weather.—&#8203;<b>In
these lay a great multitude of impotent,
blind, halt, withered.</b> Four classes intended
to embrace all forms of purely bodily disorder
of a chronic character, but not including those
possessed of evil spirits. The <em>impotent</em> are those
simply suffering from special weakness and infirmity
or from general debility; the <em>halt</em> are those
deprived from any reason of the full and free
use of their limbs; the <em>withered</em> are those
affected by paralysis or kindred disorders.—&#8203;<b>Waiting
for the moving of the water *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
was made whole of whatever
disease he had.</b> Whether this explanation, <i>i. e.</i>,
the last clause of <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 3 and the whole of <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 4,
is genuine or a later interpolation, is a question
of dispute among the critics; the weight of
authority is, on the whole, in favor of its omission;
the weight of reason is wholly so. (<i>a</i>)
The external evidence is, on the whole, against
its retention. It is wanting in the Vatican,
Cambridge, and Sinaitic manuscripts; in those
manuscripts in which it occurs, the verbal variations
are considerable. Tischendorf, Meyer,
Alford, and Tregelles all declare against it.
(<i>b</i>) The internal evidence is conclusive. If it
had been in the original, the early copyists
would not have omitted it; for in the first
centuries there was no such reluctance to accept
the supernatural, and no such discrimination
between wonders that are and wonders that are
not miracles, as would have induced its omission.
On the other hand, if no explanation of
the reason why the sick were gathered in the
porches of Bethesda were given in the original
account, it would have been very natural for
copyists to have supplied the omission by inserting
one. (<i>c</i>) The explanation offered by the
doubtful passage is itself incredible. It is a marvel,
but it is in no sense a miracle. The irregular
and fitful appearance of help by such an angelic
visitor, would have witnessed to no truth, would
have had no tendency to confer faith in God or
his grace. “That God would thus miraculously
interpose to throw down from time to time a
boon among a company of cripples, to be seized
by the most forward, selfish, and eager, leaving
the most helpless and miserable to be overwhelmed
again and again with bitter disappointment,
is a supposition not admissible.”—(<cite>Jacob
Abbott’s Notes on the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr></cite>) (<i>d</i>) These
considerations have led the latest and best
scholars, with substantial unanimity, to omit
the explanatory words of <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 4, and latter clause
of <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 3. So Alford, Tholuck, Ebrard, Trench,
Olshausen, Meyer, Tischendorf, and Tregelles.
But though it is no part of the sacred record, it
probably correctly states what was the popular
belief among the Jews, or at least among such
as resorted to this spring for cure. The real
basis of this belief is indicated by recent researches.
These have made it evident that the
pools in and about Jerusalem were connected
with each other by underground aqueducts.
Dr. Robinson gives an account of his exploration
of such an aqueduct connecting two pools,
the Fountain of the Virgin and the Pool of
Siloam. He satisfied himself that water flowed
from the one to the other reservoir, and he
witnessed the “troubling of the water” in the
Fountain of the Virgin. “We perceived the
water rapidly bubbling up from under the lower
step. In less than five minutes it had risen in
the basin nearly or quite a foot; and we could
hear it gurgling off through the interior passage.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
In ten minutes more it had ceased to flow; and
the water in the basin was again reduced to its
former level.” His observation has been since
confirmed by others. It is now difficult to see
how the Fountain of the Virgin could ever have
been surrounded by porches or made a resting-place
for the sick; and it is quite certain that
the Fountain of the Virgin cannot be asserted
with any positiveness to have been the Pool of
Bethesda. But these discoveries indicate the
probably true explanation of the troubling of
the water mentioned, not by John it will be
remembered, but by some subsequent copyist,
in the text. The Pool of Bethesda, probably,
was connected by an underground passage with
some intermittent spring, possibly possessing
healing virtues, and the bubbling of the water
from time to time gave rise to the legend of an
angelic visitant, which certain of the Jews accepted,
but which the Evangelist does not confirm,
and to which there is no reference in other
literature.</p>

<p><b>5-9. Which had an infirmity.</b> The original
implies rather a loss of power than a positive
disease; probably it was a nervous disease of
the paralytic type.—&#8203;<b>Thirty and eight years.</b>
The words “in that case,” are added by the
translator, but they correctly convey the meaning,
which is not that he had been at the Pool of
Bethesda, but that he had been diseased that
length of time.—&#8203;<b>Wilt thou be made whole?</b>
Why this question? Not necessarily because
there was any reasonable doubt whether the
man desired healing; nor because Christ required,
as a conditional preliminary, the man’s
assent to healing on the Sabbath; nor because
he would imply blame, as though the man’s
long infirmity were the result of his own weakness
of will; nor, surely, because he would
indicate that he was an impostor and desired to
use his apparent but exaggerated infirmity to
appeal to the compassion of others. All these
hypotheses have been suggested. But Christ
almost, if not quite, always requires on the part
of the healed some act of the will precedent to
and concurrent with his act of grace; the cured
are never merely receptive and quiescent. I
believe there is a deep religious meaning in this,
for every miracle is a parable of redemption, and
that our Lord would teach us that it is only as
we will to be made whole that any wholeness is
possible for us, even through omnipotent divine
grace. In this particular case it is certainly true
that the man might have traded on his infirmity
and not really desired to be cured; and though
Christ’s knowledge of character would have
rendered the question unnecessary for his own
information, it was not unnecessary to make it
clear to others that he was acting in sympathy
with the man, nor was it unimportant as a disclosure
to the man himself that he must rouse
himself from the lethargy of despair, and lay
hold, by hope, on the salvation brought to him.—&#8203;<b>I
have no man.</b> It is the friendless who
appeals peculiarly to the Friend of the sinful
and the suffering.—&#8203;<b>Rise, take up thy bed
and walk.</b> The original (<span lang="el">κράββατόν</span>) implies a
small, low bedstead. See for illustration Mark
2:4, note. Here, however, the term may be
used in a more general way, and may imply
simply a mattress which served as a couch by
day and a bed by night. Observe the command
to <cite>take up the bed</cite>. This apparently was not
necessary; I can conceive but two reasons
for it; one to emphasize the perfection of the
cure, the other to provoke the controversy with
the Pharisees respecting the Sabbath, and thus
make it the occasion for the discourse which
follows.—&#8203;<b>Immediately.</b> The instantaneousness
of the cure indicates its miraculous character;
so does its permanence. He was cured
instantly; he was cured so thoroughly that he
could not only walk, but could carry his bed;
and he remained cured.</p>

<p>I have already said that the miracles are
parables of redemption. Of no one of the miracles
is this more strikingly true than of the
present one. The diseased man has been a long
time sick. He is helpless, friendless, in despair.
He waits for an imagined moving of the water,
an expected divine cure that is to come without
act or interposition on his part; and it never
comes. Christ calls first his will into exercise:
Wilt thou be made whole? then bids him do:
“Rise, take up thy bed;” and in the choice and
the <em>obedience</em>, by faith indeed, but by the faith
which chooses and obeys, he is made instantly
and permanently well.</p>

<p><b>10-13. It is not lawful for thee to carry
thy bed.</b> The general Sabbath command was,
Thou shalt do no work. Nehemiah, enforcing
this command, forbade the carriage of commercial
burdens (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Nehemiah">Neh.</abbr> 13:19</span>). From this the Pharisees,
with their accustomed literalism, had
deduced the doctrine that nothing must be carried
on the Sabbath. To forbid this man from
carrying his bed was like forbidding a modern,
man to move a chair or a campstool. Either he

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
must have left his bed at the pool, to be stolen,
or he must have stayed there to watch it, or he
must have been allowed to take it home with
him. For the Pharisaic regulations respecting
the Sabbath, see <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
 12:2, note.—&#8203;<b>He that
made me whole said unto me.</b> The man
knew nothing about Christ or his authority.
His idea appears to have been that Christ
proved his right to give the command, Take up
thy bed and walk, by his miracle of healing.—&#8203;<b>What
man is it that said unto thee, Take
up thy bed.</b> Observe the spirit of the Pharisees.
Their question is not, Who healed thee?
but, Who said unto thee, Take up thy bed and
walk? They are blind to the miracle; they can
see only the Sabbath violation, as they regard it.—&#8203;<b>A
multitude being in that place.</b> Christ
had stopped a moment, spoken the word of
healing, and passed on into the crowd. All was
over in an instant, and because of the crowd
Christ escaped the man’s identification. This
was early in his ministry; he was not yet widely
known and thronged, as later in life. Observe
the indications of the nature of belief, an obedient
trust, not a correct intellectual apprehension.
This man had faith enough to be healed because
faith to obey Christ’s directions despite Pharisaic
criticism; yet he knew nothing of Christ’s
person, character, or work; did not even know
who he was. It is possible to have faith in even
an unknown Christ.</p>

<p><b>14-16. In the temple.</b> Possibly an indication
that the divine grace of healing had already
acted as a means of spiritual quickening.—&#8203;<b>Sin
no more, lest</b>, etc. A plain indication that the
man’s disease, probably some form of paralysis,
was an effect of sin. See note on <a href="#ch9_1"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 9:1</a>. Here,
as almost everywhere, Christ makes the physical
healing minister to a spiritual cure.—&#8203;<b>And reported
to the Judeans that it was Jesus
which had made him whole.</b> They asked
who bade him carry his bed; he replied that it
was Jesus who healed him. They asked to condemn,
he answered so as to honor Christ.—&#8203;<b>And
therefore did the Judeans come in pursuit
of Jesus.</b> Here, as very generally throughout
his gospel, John uses the word Jews (<span lang="el">Ἰουδαῖος</span>)
to signify not generally the members of the Hebrew
race, but distinctly the inhabitants of the
province of Judea. I therefore render it here
and elsewhere by the more distinctive word Judeans.
His language indicates not a legal persecution,
but a malicious pursuit. Norton translates
as I have, Came in pursuit of Jesus.
This is the literal rendering of the original verb
(<span lang="el">διώκω</span>), which however generally, though not
always, indicates a pursuit with an evil intent.
Here the meaning is not that the general cause
of the persecution which Christ suffered in Judea
was his supposed Sabbath violation, but that in
this particular instance they pursued him to call
him to account for this particular act of Sabbath
breaking. It is always the nature of the ceremonialist
to care more for the ceremony than for
man.—&#8203;<b>And sought to slay him.</b> These words
do not belong here. They have been added to
explain and correspond with the expression in
<a href="#ch5_18">verse 18</a>, Sought the more to kill him. They are
omitted by Alford, Meyer, Norton, and all the
best critical authorities.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><b>17-47.</b> In the study of the discourse which
follows, beware of considering it simply verse by
verse. It is not a collection of incidental aphorisms,
but a connected address, the theme being
the character, mission, authority, and credentials
of the Son of God. The Pharisees call Christ to
account for healing on the Sabbath; he cites in
his defence the example of his heavenly Father.
They seize upon his language, deduce from it the
conclusion that he makes himself equal with God,
and charge him with blasphemy. This serves as
the text of the discourse which follows. He declares
that he comes not to draw allegiance from,
but to, the Father; that he acts under the
Father’s will; that to him the Father has committed
the whole work of grace on the earth;
that he is even now raising the spiritually dead
to life; that he is to raise the physically dead to
a new life; and that he will finally complete this
work entrusted to him, by declaring and executing
the divine judgment. The evidence of
his mission and authority is not in his own
words; he is testified to by John the Baptist;
by his own life and work; and by the Scriptures
of the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> He closes by pointing out the
secret cause of the Jews’ rejection of him, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>,
their personal ambition. Beware, too, of imputing
to the words a dogmatic meaning borrowed
from later ecclesiastical controversies, which
they did not bear in the minds of his hearers at

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
the time. There is little or nothing here
respecting the relations of the Son to the
Father, except as the language throughout
implies that the Son is subordinate to and
dependent upon the Father; but the relation
of the Son to the human race is clearly revealed,
the relation of life-giver and judge, and is certainly
not that of any man, however endowed,
to his fellow-men. Nevertheless this address
contains the christology of Jesus Christ, his own
teaching concerning his own character and work;
and it clearly implies, on the one hand, that he
not only represents the Father, as an ambassador
might represent a king, that he is not only
clothed with divine authority, as Moses was
clothed, in the administration of the theocracy,
with the authority of God, but that he is a
partaker of the divine nature; nor less clearly,
on the other hand, does it imply that his authority
is derived from the Father, that his power is
conferred on him by the Father, that he executes
in all things the will of the Father, that he is to
be conceived of not as distinct from, but as one
with the Father, and that his object is in all
things to be a way unto the Father. Against
every form of tri-theism, against all substitution
of the Son in the place of the Father, this discourse
is a solemn and earnest admonition, no
less than against all belittling of either his character
to that of man or angel, or his mission to
that of mere messenger or teacher.</p>

<p><b>17. My Father worketh hitherto, and I
work.</b> The argument is very brief; it is based
on the premises that we are to be followers of
God as dear children (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 5:1</span>), that the Father’s
work is a pattern for our own working. It
gives color to the opinion that the days of creation
are long eons or periods; that the seventh
day, which God blessed and on which he rested,
is the present period in which the mere physical
work of creation has given place to the higher
work of redemption; thus the Sabbath of God
becomes both interpreted and an interpreter to
us of what our Sabbath should be. The divine
work does not cease; the grass grows, the buds
swell, the flowers bloom, the fruits ripen, the
rains fall, the winds <span style="white-space:nowrap;">blow,—but</span> all this is the
work of love; over all this work God’s tender
mercies brood (<span class="muchsmaller">Psalm 145:9</span>). The lesson of nature
interpreted here by Christ is that the work of
love is never a violation of the true Sabbath law.
This verse, with <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 12:8 and Mark 2:27,
give the three canons for the Christian observance
of the Sabbath. (1) The Son of man is
Lord also of the Sabbath. It is then a Christian
day, belongs to the Christian dispensation, is
under the Lordship of Christ and in his kingdom,
and is to be kept in that spirit of joyous
freedom with which Christ makes free. (2) The
Sabbath is made for man. It is therefore man’s
day; belongs to all men, Gentile and Jew, poor
and rich; a day to be used <em>for</em> man; so that
whatever work is necessary to the real abiding
welfare of the human race, is not foreign to this
day. (3) My Father worketh hitherto. The
Father’s work is the example and the law for
his children; the work of love, the work for
others, the work that has tender mercy for its
inspiration and its overseer, is Sabbath work.
It is to be our rest-day as it is our heavenly
Father’s rest-day, and only so; a prophecy of
that eternal rest which will be one of glorious
activity: a rest from care, from worldliness,
from the common temptations of life, but not
a day of mere dull cessation of labor.</p>

<p><b>18. Because he had not only broken
the Sabbath.</b> Literally <dfn>relaxed</dfn> (<span lang="el">λύω</span>) the Sabbath.
See note on <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:19 for meaning of
the word. The Pharisees then, as the literalists
now, believe that the sanctity of the Sabbath
could only be preserved by putting the soul
under bonds to a literal compliance with specific
regulations. Christ broke these bonds asunder,
gave the soul liberty, and preserved the Sabbath
by inspiring the souls of his disciples with allegiance
to himself, love for humanity, and sympathy
with the redeeming work of the Father.
He did relax what they supposed to be essential
to the preservation of the day, but what
was really destroying it. To keep this poor
man on his bed, or watching it to prevent it
from being stolen, would have destroyed for
him the rest of the day, in order that he might
comply with the letter of the Pharisaic regulations.
So he who rides in a horse-car rather
than remain away from church, or travels late
Saturday night or early Sunday morning rather
than destroy his Sabbath by spending it with
strangers, seems to the Sabbatarian of to-day to
be relaxing the Sabbath, while he may be in truth
preserving it.—&#8203;<b>But said also that God was
his own Father.</b> (<span lang="el">πατέρα ἴδιον</span>.) Norton
renders the sense accurately though freely, <cite>Had
spoken of God as particularly his Father</cite>. The
meaning of the original will be indicated to the
English reader by <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:32, “Spared not <em>his
own</em> Son;” 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 6:18, “Sinneth against <em>his
own</em> body;” 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 7:2, “Have <em>her own</em> husband.”
It is clear that the Jews either did
understand Christ by his language to claim

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
peculiar relations with God, or pretended so
to do. In his mere reference to God as Father
there was no such claim, for he bids us
all call him our Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 6:6, 7</span>). True, in the
language “<em>my</em> Father,” most commentators see
a ground for the interpretation put upon his
language by the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Judeans:—thus</span> Meyer: “They
rightly interpreted ‘my Father’ as signifying
peculiar and personal fatherhood;” Bengel:
“The Only-begotten alone can say, ‘my Father’;”
similarly Alford, Tholuck, and others.
There is perhaps some ground for this view.
Yet I can hardly think that Christ’s mere
designation of God as “<em>my</em> Father” implies
more than Paul’s “Abba Father” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:15</span>),
which Luther renders “dear Father,” or the
frequent designation of God as <em>my</em> God by the patriarchs,
and especially by David. See for example,
<abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> 15:2; 1 <abbr title="Chronicles">Chron.</abbr> 28:20;
2 <abbr title="Chronicles">Chron.</abbr> 18:13;
<abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 22:1, 10; 38:21; 71:12;
2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 12:21;
<abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 4:19. And in Psalm 89:26;
<abbr title="Jeremiah">Jer.</abbr> 3:4, man
is directed by God to apply this very phrase
“my Father” in his address to God. I believe
then that the statement that Jesus said that
God was <em>in a peculiar sense</em> his Father, and the
deduction that he thus made himself equal to
God, are the malicious wresting of his words by
the Judeans, for the very purpose of finding an
occasion of offence. They manifested the same
spirit in John 10:31, etc., though there they
have better ground for the interpretation which
they put upon his words. In the discourse
which follows, Christ does not hold them to
their original charge respecting the Sabbath.
He follows them into the new ground which
they have entered on, and expounds his true
nature and mission.—&#8203;<b>Making himself equal
with God.</b> “On the same level with God”
(<cite>Meyer</cite>); “On an equality with God” (<cite>Norton</cite>);
“Of the same nature and condition”
(<cite>Robinson</cite>). The language of Jesus, his claim
of the right to work because the Father works,
and his language <em>My Father</em>, the Judeans regard
as embodying an assumption that he is of the
divine nature and possesses the divine prerogatives.
That they so interpreted his language
does not prove that it is to be so interpreted.
The Pharisees are not authorized interpreters of
the words of Christ. His claim we must interpret
for ourselves from the discourse which
follows. How far does he correct and how far
confirm their interpretation? It seems to me
clear that at the very outset he materially modifies
it, in his declaration of his obedience to and
dependence upon and work under the Father
(<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch5_19"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 19</a></span>), while he confirms the substantial idea
that he possesses the same nature as the Father,
is, so to speak, of kin to Him, by his declaration
that he does what the Father does (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch5_19"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 19</a></span>), shares
in all the counsels of the Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch5_20"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 20</a></span>), gives
life to the dead as the Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch5_21"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 21</a></span>), judges all
men for the Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch5_22"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 22</a></span>), is to be honored as
the representative of the Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch5_23"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 23</a></span>), is the
door through which all must enter into eternal
life in the Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch5_24"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 24</a></span>), and is the final Resurrection
and Judge for the Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch5_25"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 25-29</a></span>); yet
at the close he again emphasizes the truth that
in all this he is not a second or even subordinate
God, but the One through whom the Father
does all (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch5_30"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 30</a></span>), the one mediator between God
and man (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 2:5</span>).</p>

<p><b>19, 20. Verily, verily.</b> A formula used
by Christ in cases of important and emphatic
affirmation.—&#8203;<b>The Son can do nothing of
himself</b>, <i>i. e.</i>, of his own will or authority.
“Of myself (<span lang="el">ἀφ’ ἑαυτοῦ</span>), <i>i. e.</i>, of one’s own will
or accord, without authority or command from
another.”—(<abbr title="Robinson"><cite>Rob.</cite></abbr> 24, art. <span lang="el">ἀπό</span>.) This declaration
cannot be limited, as by Calvin, to the power of
Christ in his human nature, without, adding to
the verse what is not in it, nor in its necessary
connection; nor can we read it, as Chrysostom
does, that Christ can do nothing contrary to his
Father’s will, because of the perfect union between
them, for this is clearly not the meaning
of the original. Christ says not, I can do
nothing contrary to my Father, but, I can do
nothing <em>of myself</em> by my own independent and
original power. The meaning of the original is
transparent, though the truth is transcendent.
This is that <em>the power of Christ is not an original
but a derived power</em>; that it comes from
the Father and is a power only to do those
things which carry out the Father’s will. As
the Christian can do nothing without Christ
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch15_5">15:5</a></span>), yet can do all things through Christ
strengthening him (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 4:13</span>), so Christ can do
nothing without the Father, but does all things
by virtue of a divine power imparted to him by the
Father, and as a manifestation of the Father.
This is a partial answer to the charge that
Christ makes himself equal to the Father. He
show’s that so far from doing anything calculated
to draw away allegiance from the Father,
he draws allegiance to the Father, since in all
that he does he acts out only the Father’s will.
He is divine because of the divinity with which he
has, so to speak, been clothed by the Father’s

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
love.—&#8203;<b>But what he seeth the Father do.</b>
“A familiar description, borrowed from the
attention which children give to their <span style="white-space:nowrap;">father—of</span>
the inner and immediate intention which the
Son perpetually has of the Father’s will, in the
perfect consciousness of fellowship of life with
Him.”—(<cite>Meyer.</cite>)—<b>Whatsoever things he
doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</b>
<em>In like manner</em> (<span lang="el">ὁμοίως</span>), that is, with like power
and authority. This surely could be said of no
man, no angel. It indicates not only a superhuman
but also a super-angelic character. Thus
this verse puts in a very compact form the paradox
of Christ’s character—a paradox not to be
explained away by either modifications of the first
clause or denials of the second. The first clause
asserts that Christ’s power comes from the
Father, and thus, in a sense, is not equal to
that of the Father, which is uncreated and
underived. And with this declaration agree
many other passages of Scripture. See for
example, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch7_17">7:17</a>,
<a href="#ch7_18">18</a>; <a href="#ch8_42">8:42</a>; <a href="#ch14_10">14:10</a>; <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr>
2:9; <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 1:9; 3:2. The second clause
asserts that this power, conferred upon the
Son, is that of the Father, who has put all
things into the hands of the Son that he may
be Lord of all. Acts 10:36; James 5:9; <abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr>
1:16, 17; 3:11. It is noticeable that John,
who of all Evangelists makes most clear the
divine nature of Christ, as well as his divine mission,
is the one who more clearly than any other
of the evangelists asserts his dependence on the
Father.—&#8203;<b>For the Father loveth the Son</b>, etc.
This is stated as the reason why the Son is able to
do all things that the Father doeth. His power
is derived from the Father through the Father’s
love for him. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 1:9.—&#8203;<b>And showeth
him all things.</b> “He who loves hides nothing.”—(<cite>Bengel.</cite>)—<b>He
will show him greater works
than these.</b> Greater miracles than the healing
of the impotent man. Far greater works were
done later in Christ’s ministry in Jerusalem and
vicinity, the consummation being the raising of
Lazarus from the dead.—&#8203;<b>That ye may marvel.</b>
Here the verb <dfn>marvel</dfn> (<span lang="el">θαυμάζω</span>) is used with the
idea of praise as well as wonder. The object of
the wonderful works of God is not merely to
awaken the wonder of mankind, but, through
the wonder, the reverence and so the allegiance
of mankind to the Father through Christ his
Son.</p>

</div>

<p><b>21-23. For as the Father raiseth up the
dead and maketh them to live, even so
the Son, whom he will, makes to live.</b>
Observe, (1) that the verbs in this sentence are in
the present tense; Christ is therefore speaking
of a <em>present</em> resurrection, one now taking place.
(2) That this resurrection is one recognized
among men, not one taking place in the invisible
world (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch5_23"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 23</a></span>). (3) That as the result of this
resurrection, the raised pass from death unto
life (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch5_24"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 24</a></span>). (4) That a universal resurrection is
not indicated, but only of those whom <em>he wills</em>
to raise (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch5_21"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 21</a></span>). It is then not of a future resurrection
of all men at the last day, nor of a present
resurrection of the literally dead taking place as
they die, that Christ here speaks, but of a spiritual
resurrection, taking place on the earth, confined
to those whom the Saviour calls and who
hear and answer his call, and so manifest to men
that it is recognized as a sign of the Saviour’s
power. As Christ has power on earth to forgive
sins (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 2:10</span>), so also he has power to raise the
dead in trespasses and sins. Thus he is now, as
he will be in another sense in the last day, the
resurrection and the life (<span class="muchsmaller">John 11:25</span>). This theme
of a spiritual resurrection and life-giving occupies
verses 21-27; then by a natural transition Christ
passes to the future resurrection of the physical
dead. Be not surprised, he says in substance, at
my declarations respecting the spiritual resurrection;
for the final resurrection shall also be at
my voice. Be not surprised at my claim to be
now a judge, for the great day of judgment the
Father has also committed into my hands.—&#8203;<b>Whom
he will.</b> This phrase does not indicate
“that he specially confers this grace on none but
certain men, that is, on the elect” (<cite>Calvin</cite>); nor
can we say that “He will not quicken others because
they believe not” (<cite>Meyer</cite>), for though this
is true, it is neither asserted, nor even hinted at
here; nor is the meaning merely that “in every
instance where his will is to vivify, the result invariably
follows” (<cite>Alford</cite>). Clearly the indication
of the passage is that spiritual life has its
source, not in the will of the sinner but in that of
the Saviour (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch1_13">1:13</a>; <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 9:16</span>); but the reason
why the divine will apparently chooses some
and not others, whether for reasons in human
character and choice, or for inscrutable reasons,
not explained nor indeed explicable, is not here
hinted at.—&#8203;<b>For the Father judgeth no man.</b>
The whole work of judgment, the whole moral
government of the world, the whole course of
divine Providence, as regards the nation, the
church, and the individual, is entrusted to the
Son. See Psalm 2; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 1:5.—&#8203;<b>That all men
should honor the Son even as they honor

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
the Father.</b> There is some reasonable ground
for a difference of opinion as to the proper interpretation
of the preceding verses, which treat of
the relations of the Father to the Son; and
Christian critics are not wholly agreed respecting
their meaning. But there can be no room for
difference of opinion as to the meaning of this
verse, which gives the practical outcome of those
which precede. Whatever opinion the theologian
may entertain concerning the mystery of
Christ’s nature, the Christian can hardly doubt
the plain teaching of Scripture that the highest
allegiance that the soul can pay to its God, the
highest love it can offer, the highest reverence it
can experience, are all due to the Son. <em>Even as</em>
signifies the manner and the degree. So in
heaven the highest praises are paid to the Lamb
slain from the foundation of the world (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 5:12;
7:10</span>).—&#8203;<b>He that honoreth not the Son, honoreth
not the Father which hath sent
him.</b> Not because the failure to honor an ambassador
is a failure to honor the king whom he
represents, but because the honor paid to God
belongs to his character, and of that character
the Son is the manifestation; so that the soul
that does not honor the Son, who is the brightness
of the Father’s image, and who doeth all
things which the Father does, and as the Father
does them, does not really honor the Father. In
truth, he who does not recognize in Christ the
Son of the Father, the true image of the divine
glory, has either no true conception of the Son
or none of the Father; for the only way to the
Father is the Son. And in fact, those forms of
theological doctrine which have tended to belittle
Christ have also tended, in the history of the
church, to dwarf worship.</p>

that heareth me and hath faith on him
that sent me, hath eternal life, and comes
not into judgment, but has passed out of
the death into the life.</b> The meaning of this
declaration is not obscure, though it has been
sometimes obscured by unbelief. To <em>hear the
word of Christ</em> is to hear it with the spiritual ear,
not merely with the physical ear. Thus those
may be included who have never heard of the
historic Christ; for as he is the Light of the
world, who lighteth <em>every man</em> who cometh into
the world (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch1_9">1:9</a>, note</span>), so those who, without the
literal hearing of his words, do hear and attend
to the message which he speaks to the soul, in
the inner experience, are to be included among
those who hear his words. To <em>have faith on him
that sent me</em>, is not merely to believe his written
word, nor to believe that he has sent Christ into
the world, nor to believe any specific dogma respecting
Christ, however important, but to have
faith in an unseen divinity, in contrast to faith in
either one’s self or in any human helper. It is to
direct faith toward this unseen God that Christ
came into the world; and to have faith in Christ
is to have faith in the Father who sent him,
in order that he might bring all unto the Father,
and present all to him (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
 <a href="#ch17_8">17:8</a>, <a href="#ch17_21">21</a>, <a href="#ch17_24">24</a></span>). <em>Cometh not
into judgment</em> is mistranslated in our English version,
<em>Shall not come into condemnation</em>. The verb
is not future, and the noun is judgment, not condemnation.
“There can be no good reason why
the word (<span lang="el">κρίσις</span>, <dfn>krisis</dfn>) should be rendered <dfn>judgment</dfn>
in the 22d verse, and <dfn>condemnation</dfn> in the
24th. But from a fear, I suppose, lest the one
should seem to contradict the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">other—lest</span> the
Son should be thought not to execute the judgment
that had been committed to <span style="white-space:nowrap;">him—they</span> (the
translators) were unfaithful to the letter, perhaps
even more unfaithful to the spirit, of the
passage.”—(<cite>Maurice.</cite>) The promise is one fulfilled
in this life, a promise of present not merely
future deliverance, and of a deliverance not
merely from condemnation, but from judgment.
If the Christian comes into judgment, he would
also inevitably come into condemnation (<span class="muchsmaller">1 John 1:8,
10</span>). The meaning of this verse then is, that
when the soul has accepted Christ as its Master,
hearing his words, and following him, for spiritual
hearing involves following (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
 <a href="#ch10_3">10:3</a>, <a href="#ch10_4">4</a></span>) so as
to live by faith in God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 2:20</span>), he is no longer
subject to divine judgment; there is no more
condemnation to them who are thus in Christ
Jesus (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:1</span>). With this is involved the further
truth that there will be no true judgment
for them in the last day. “The reckoning which
ends with ‘Well done, good and faithful servant,’
is not judgment; the reward is of free grace.
In this sense the believers in Christ will not be
judged according to their works; they are justified
before God by faith, and by God.”—(<cite>Alford.</cite>)
Finally, the last clause of the verse, <cite>but hath
passed out of death into life</cite>, indicates the true
condition of both the impenitent and the believer;
the one is already in death, from which
he can only be delivered by the Life-giver; the
other has already entered into eternal life. This
is not a future reward reserved for him; it begins
here and now, though it is to be consummated
hereafter. <em>The</em> life is spiritual life, <em>the</em>
death spiritual death. Of these great realities

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
physical life and death are but tropes and
symbols.</p>

<p><b>25-27. The hour is coming, and now is,
when</b>, etc. The resurrection here spoken of is
then one already taking place. In order to meet
this evident requirement of the verse, those
commentators who regard Christ as throughout
this passage speaking of the final resurrection
suppose here a reference to the cases of resurrection
which took place in connection with his
ministry. But none such had as yet taken place;
moreover, this construction requires us to suppose
that Christ used the word <em>life</em> in one sense
in the preceding verse and in another sense here,
without giving any indication of the change of
meaning. His reference then I believe to be
here, as throughout this passage up to verse 28,
to spiritual death and spiritual resurrection.—&#8203;<b>For
as the Father hath life in himself, so
he hath given to the Son to have life in
himself.</b> Norton renders this somewhat enigmatical
verse liberally, thus: “For as the Father
is the fountain of life, so hath he given to the
Son to be the fountain of life.” This must be
regarded rather as a paraphrase than as a translation;
but it embodies well the meaning of the
verse, as indicated by the context. No man is a
fountain of life to any other man. He may be a
conduit, but not a source. It is given to Christ
to be a source of life himself to others. We live
only as we draw continuously our life from God;
to the Son the Father has given life in such a
sense that he becomes himself the life of the
world, and thus the life-giver to the dead.—&#8203;<b>Because
he is a Son of man.</b> Not, as in the
English version, <em>the</em> Son of man. The omission
of the article is significant, for without the article
the phrase son of man means simply one of the
human race; with the article it always means
the Messiah. Here then the meaning is that
Christ is to be the judge of all the earth, because
he has taken on himself human nature. Why is
this any reason that he should be the judge of
the world? The answer is, I think, indicated by
<abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 5:15: “We have not an high-priest which
cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities,
but was tempted in all points like as we
are, yet without sin.” Our judge is chosen, because
he knows our frame, he understands sympathetically
our temptations, is able to make
allowances for all infirmities and weaknesses of
humanity, and for all trials of life, and able, also,
to measure at their true worth the false excuses
with which we endeavor to excuse ourselves to
ourselves and to our fellows. Other explanations,
for which in detail see Meyer, as that judgment
is a necessary part of redemption, or that
it belongs to Christ as the Messiah, or that it is
given to him as a reward for accepting the humility
of human nature, seem to me to be inadmissible.
Judgment is not a part of redemption;
it is in no true sense redemptive; the
phrase <em>a</em> son of man never means the Messiah;
and it would be no reward to a tender and loving
nature to exercise judgment, except as it afforded
an opportunity for the exercise of mercy in
judgment.</p>

<p><b>28, 29. Marvel not at this.</b> Not only because
the greater wonder absorbs the less (<cite>Meyer</cite>),
but also because there is nothing strange in
the declaration that he who is to be the final
judge of all flesh should exercise judgment now
on men, and he who is to be the final resurrection
and the life should be the resurrection and the
life in the spiritual realm now.—&#8203;<b>For the hour
is coming.</b> He does not add <em>and now is</em>, for
now he is speaking not of a present resurrection,
but of one to take place only in the future.—&#8203;<b>All
that are in their graves shall hear his
voice, and shall come forth.</b> A voice like
the sound of a trumpet (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 1:10</span>), and like the
sound of many waters (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 1:15</span>), that is, like the
roar of the ocean for fullness and power. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>
1 <abbr title="Thessalonians">Thess.</abbr> 4:16. The entire language is highly
figurative. If literally interpreted it would
seem to imply a bodily resurrection, and it is
apparently so understood by some of the commentators,
<i>e. g.</i>, Alford and Olshausen; but it is
evident that it cannot be literally interpreted.
Thus the dead do not in a literal sense hear his
voice; their arousing is not that of literal sleepers
who have been awakened by a voice. The
doctrine that death is a sleep, that the soul remains
in an unconscious state till the resurrection,
and that the life is then anew given to the
soul simultaneously with the re-creation of the
body from the dust, is so inconsistent with the
plain teaching of Scripture in many passages (<span class="muchsmaller">see
1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 15:36-38, 50, 51</span>), that it cannot be sustained by
doubtful interpretations of pictorial passages
like the present one. How little ground there is
for the opinion that the Bible supports a doctrine
of a literal and universal bodily resurrection,
will be evident to the student who considers the
force of the following passages, which are said
by Olshausen, and quoted with apparent approval
by Alford, both of whom seem to believe
in a literal resurrection of the body, to be the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
only passages in Scripture which imply a resurrection
of the bodies of the impenitent: Acts
24:15; <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 10:28; <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 25:34, etc.; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr>
20:5, 12; <abbr title="Daniel">Dan.</abbr> 12:2. No one of these directly
asserts the resurrection of the body, and some
of them can hardly be said even remotely to imply
it. The doctrine is directly inconsistent with
the teaching of Paul in 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr>, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 15. See notes
there.—&#8203;<b>They that have done good unto the
resurrection of life.</b> That is, unto a resurrection
the necessary result of which is life, life
in the Messiah’s kingdom.—&#8203;(<cite>Meyer.</cite>)—<b>And they
that have practised evil.</b> The righteous
have <em>done</em> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">good—their</span> fruit remains; the wicked
have only <em>practised</em> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">evil—their</span> works do not follow
them. The wheat is garnered into the storehouses;
the chaff is destroyed. See <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch3_20">3:20</a>,
<a href="#ch3_21">21</a>.—&#8203;<b>Unto the resurrection of judgment.</b>
Observe again that only they that have done evil
come into judgment (<span class="muchsmaller">verse <a href="#ch5_24">24</a>, note</span>). Observe too
that it is they that have done good to whom is
given the gift of eternal life, and they that have
practised evil that enter into judgment. The
test, and the only test of character which the
New Testament recognizes, is that of fruit in the
actual life (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>7:20; 12:33; 25:31-46; <abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 5:6;
1 John 3:7, 8</span>). The works of righteousness are the
fruits of the Spirit; his gracious influences are
received into the soul by faith, but the evidence
of the abiding of that Spirit consists in the manifestation
of these fruits in a righteous life (<span class="muchsmaller">John
15:1, 2, 6; <abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 5:22-24; James 2:14-26</span>). Living a Christ-like
life is the only evidence of possessing a
Christ-like spirit.</p>

there is no law superior to his own will; to the
Son the will of the Father is the law. In this
declaration our Lord gives us an example of the
way in which we may secure just judgments in
ourselves. It is self-seeking which obscures the
judgment. Unselfish seeking of the Father’s
will is the great clarifier of the moral judgments
of the disciple.</p>

<p><b>31.</b> This verse makes a transition from the
subject-matter of the discourse thus far to a new
subject. Christ has been speaking of his own
character and authority; he now passes to speak
of the evidences which attest it. The verse is to
be read not affirmatively, but interrogatively.
Do you say, if I bear witness of myself, my witness
is not true? I will then point you to other
testimony. That this is the true reading of the
verse is evident from <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch8_14">8:14</a>, where Christ declares
that though he bears witness of himself,
his witness is true. He here anticipates the objection
there made by the Pharisees (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
 <a href="#ch8_13">8:13</a></span>), and
replies to it. In his reply, which extends to
verse <a href="#ch5_39">39</a>, he cites in attestation of his mission
three witnesses: (1) the testimony of John the
Baptist (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verses">vers.</abbr> <a href="#ch5_32">32-35</a></span>); (2) his own works, including,
but only incidentally, his miracles (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch5_36">36</a></span>); (3) the

<p><b>32, 33. There is another that beareth
witness of me.</b> Most of the modern commentators
consider this <em>another</em> to be the Father. So
Alford, Meyer, Bengel, Tholuck, and others.
They understand the connection to be this: The
Father testifies to me; John’s testimony I do not
receive, because it is human and fallible, but in
passing I refer to it, for your salvation. Thus
verses 33-35 are parenthetical. The other interpretation
seems to me the more natural and preferable.
Christ gives, in an ascending climax, a
threefold testimony to himself: first the testimony
of John, a prophet, rather the prophet and
forerunner of the Messiah; then his own works;
finally the testimony of the Father, in the heart
and through the written word.—&#8203;<b>And I know
that the witness which he witnesseth of
me is true.</b> Such language confirming the testimony
of John the Baptist is natural; such language
in confirmation of the testimony of the
Father seems to me strained and unnatural.
What significance can be given to the statement,
The Everlasting Father testifies of me, and I
know that his testimony of me is true? It is apt
if applied to John the Baptist, a human and fallible
witness, whose language might be attributed
by the Jews to extraordinary and mistaken
admiration.—&#8203;<b>Ye sent unto John.</b> The reference
is probably to the delegation which came
out from Jerusalem to inquire into John’s character
and work (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_19">1:19</a></span>).—&#8203;<b>He bare witness

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
unto the truth.</b> That is, To the truth concerning
Jesus Christ. By this declaration Christ
makes the christology of John the Baptist his
own, and declares of himself that he is the Son
of God and the Lamb of God that taketh away
the sins of the world. See <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>

<p><b>34, 35. But I receive not testimony
from man.</b> This is not equivalent to, I will not
avail myself of human witness in this matter
(<cite>Meyer</cite>); he does in fact avail himself of human
witness, cites it, and declares the reason why he
does so, that his auditors may by it be saved
from fatal error; nor does it merely mean, as
Calvin, that he cites this testimony out of regard
to them rather than to himself, though this is
true, and equally true of all his ministry, and of
all the testimony which he cites in support of his
divine claims. Here, as in so many other places
in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>, especially in the reports of Christ’s
words, the careful study of the original clears up
obscurity which is felt in the translation, and
sometimes which any mere translation fails to
clear away. <dfn>From</dfn> (<span lang="el">παρά</span>), when joined to verbs
of inquiring, asking, and learning, indicates that
the matter to be learned is viewed as in the mental
possession of the person cited (see <cite>Winer</cite>, § 47,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 365), that is, as derived from him and dependent
on his testimony. So in common language
with us, “I know such a fact to be true, for I
learned it <em>from</em> Mr. A.,” indicates Mr. A. as the
<em>authority</em> for the statement. Christ’s declaration
here then is, not that he will not use human testimony,
but that his claims do not depend upon
it. Compare <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 11:27, “No man knoweth
the Son but the Father,” and <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 16:17,
“Flesh and blood hath not revealed it (the truth
respecting Jesus) unto thee, but my Father
which is in heaven.” The testimony of John the
Baptist, like that of all the prophets, is not in
truth testimony of or from man, but testimony
<em>from</em> God, <em>through</em> man, the man speaking as he
is moved by the Holy Ghost. And the moral for
us is that all mere human argument for and witness
to the character of Christ breaks down; it
is only as the divine character has been divinely
revealed to us, by the Spirit of God, that we can
hope to persuade others of the truth, a lesson
abundantly confirmed in the history of the church
by its dealings with infidelity. Unbelief is to
be vanquished by spiritual, not by mere intellectual
power. Alford represents the idea well by
a free translation, “I take not my testimony
from man.”—<b>These things I say that ye
might be saved.</b> Blind to the testimony of the
<abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 3:14</span>), unspiritual, and therefore deaf
to the inner voice of God (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 2:14</span>), there is hope
that they may heed the recent testimony of John,
whom all men counted for a prophet (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 21:26</span>),
and whose baptism even the Pharisees and the
Sadducees had attended (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 3:7</span>). Therefore
he cites it to them, that he may by any means
save some. He seeks to outflank their prejudice.—&#8203;<b>He
was the lamp, kindled and shining.</b>
Observe the difference between this translation
and that of our English version. He was not <em>a
light</em>, but <em>the lamp</em>; not <em>burning</em>, but <em>kindled</em>. A
common title given to famous Rabbis was The
candle of the law; Christ borrows it, applies it
to John, and declares him to have been <em>the</em> lamp,
lighting not the law, but the way to Christ. <em>The</em>
lamp, because the one foretold in the prophets
to light the way of the Lord and prepare for his
coming. The <em>lamp</em>, not <em>light</em>. Two different
Greek words (<span lang="el">λύχνος</span> and <span lang="el">φῶς</span>) are erroneously
rendered by the same English word, <em>light</em>. Man
is but a <em>lamp</em>; Christ is <em>the light</em> which lighteth
every man that cometh into the world (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_9">1:9</a></span>);
and man (the lamp) can give light to others
only as he is himself filled with Christ (the true
and only light). This lamp is <em>kindled</em> (<span lang="el">καιόμενος</span>,
passive), <i>i. e.</i>, by the touch of God, as a lamp unable
to give light until it is filled and lighted by
the owner’s hand; and <em>shining</em>, as one of the
lights of the world (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:14</span>), shining with
divine light because kindled by a divine hand
and partaking of the divine nature (<i lang="la">lumen
illuminatum</i>, not <i lang="la">lumen illuminans</i>).—&#8203;<b>And ye
were willing for a season to rejoice in his
light.</b> The two marks of a spurious religious
enthusiasm. They were willing to <em>rejoice</em>, but
not to <em>repent</em>; they were ready to “enjoy religion,”
but not to “bring forth fruit meet for
repentance;” they flocked in great crowds to
John’s Baptism (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 3:5</span>), much as men now
flock to camp and tabernacle meetings; but they
were not ready to “do justly, love mercy, and
walk humbly before God.” And their enthusiasm
was but “for a season,” as all merely emotional
enthusiasm is. It made no practical and lifelong
change in their character or conduct.</p>

<a href="#ch5_20">20</a>, <a href="#ch5_21">21</a></span>); (<i>c</i>) the
phrase “hath given me to finish” points forward
to the time when he should be able to say in prayer
to his Father, “I have finished the work which
thou gavest me to do” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
 <a href="#ch17_5">17:5</a>; <abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> <a href="#ch4_34">4:34</a></span>), and in
his last triumphant cry upon the cross, “It is
finished” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
 <a href="#ch19_30">19:30</a></span>). The matter is important
because the church needs to recognize that the
evidences of Christianity on which Christ relied
are not the miracles, which are purely historical
acts, the historic veracity of which must be
proved like that of any other past events, but
the whole work of redeeming love, the visible
and indubitable fruits of which are to be unceasingly
seen in the victories of Christianity over
the individual and over communities.—&#8203;<b>The
same works that I am doing.</b> Not <em>have
done</em>, which might have been said of miracles already
wrought, but <em>am now engaged in doing</em>,
which alone could be said of the unceasing work
of him who ever went about doing good. Observe
that the works which he is doing are those
which the Father <em>hath given him to do</em> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verses">vers.</abbr>
<a href="#ch6_19">19</a>, <a href="#ch6_20">20</a>,

<p><b>37, 38. And he which hath sent me, the
Father himself, hath borne witness of
me.</b> The past tense of the verb indicates a completed
testimony, borne in past time, but accessible
to present hearers. The meaning therefore
cannot be the witness of the Spirit to Christ’s character
and mission, a continuously fresh testimony,
which is however borne only to those that are
already the sons of God, through a measurable
faith in Jesus as Saviour and Messiah. The reference
is possibly in part to the testimony which
the Father had borne at the baptism to Christ as
his well-beloved Son (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 3:17</span>), a testimony repeated
on other occasions (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 17:5; John 12:28</span>);
but the primary reference is to the testimony
borne to God in the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> Scriptures, which were
to the Jewish nation witnesses to the Messiah,
whose coming they heralded, and whose work
they described (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 24:27-44; Acts 13:27</span>).—&#8203;<b>No
voice of his have ye ever heard, no appearance
of his have ye ever seen, and his
word ye have not abiding in you.</b> This
gives as nearly literally as is possible the meaning
of the original. Two interpretations are
possible. One is that indicated by our English
version. According to this interpretation Christ
declares the general philosophic truth, that the
Father is a Spirit, and therefore invisible and
inaudible, to be spiritually discerned; and since
the Jews have not spiritual discernment, since
they have not God’s word abiding in them, they
are without any knowledge of God or understanding
of his witness. The other interpretation
is that indicated by the more literal translation
given above. According to this translation it is
the language of “reproach for want of susceptibility
to this (divine) testimony” (<cite>Meyer</cite>). This
was the view of Calvin, who here, as in the interpretation
of so many other passages, anticipated
the results of later criticism. “When he says
that they had never heard the voice of God or
seen his shape, these are metaphorical expressions,
by which he intends to state generally that
they are utterly estranged from the knowledge
of God.” This last I believe to be the correct
interpretation, both because it more nearly accords
with the literal rendering of the original,
and because, according to the other interpretation,
Christ inserts in the midst of his discourse
an abstract statement of philosophic truth, in a
manner which, if not absolutely artificial, is at
least quite unlike his usual method. <cite>His word
abiding in you</cite> is the word of the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> This
they had; but it was external to them. They
did not believe it “with the heart unto righteousness”
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 10:10</span>). It was not an abiding force in
the shaping of their conduct or the formation of
their character. He only can truly comprehend
what the Scriptures teach concerning God, who
yields obedience to whatever they teach concerning
duty; for it is only as the divine attributes
are reproduced in us that we can approximate
an understanding of them in God.—&#8203;<b>For whom
he hath sent, in him ye have not faith.</b>
This may be regarded either as the reason why
they have not seen God nor heard his voice, because
they have not faith in his Son; or as the
evidence that they have not seen God, etc., since
if they had they would have faith in his Son.
The latter is the preferable interpretation, He
that is truly and spiritually familiar with the
Father will discern the Father’s lineaments in the
Son; he that does not recognize the divinity in

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
the Son bears thereby witness that he does not
truly know in what divinity consists.</p>

<p><b>39, 40. Ye search the Scriptures because
in them ye think ye have eternal
life; and they are they which testify concerning
me; and still ye will not come
unto me that ye might have life.</b> The verb
<dfn>search</dfn> (<span lang="el">ερευνᾶτε</span>) may be rendered either as imperative
or as indicative. Alford and Tholuck
make it, as does the English version, imperative,
thus interpreting it as a direction to search the
Scriptures; Meyer, Bengel, Olshausen, and Godet
make it indicative, thus interpreting it as a
statement of a fact and a basis for the condemnation
which follows. Which interpretation is correct
is to be determined wholly by the context
and the circumstances; either is grammatically
correct. It appears to me clear, both from the
context and the audience, that Christ does not
give here a command or an exhortation, but
simply states a fact. For (1) he is addressing
men who did not need a direction to Scriptural
study; the great, almost the exclusive, study of
the Jewish Rabbis was either the Scriptures or
the commentaries thereon. It is true that their
search was not spiritual; they stopped with the
letter which killeth, and disregarded the spirit
which giveth life; but this was a reason, not for
an exhortation to more searching, but to a different
spirit in the searching. (2) The theme of
Christ’s discourse here would not naturally lead
to an exhortation to Bible study. He is pointing
them to himself; and their failure to find him
was not because they were not familiar with the
Scriptures, but because a veil was over their
hearts when they read it (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 3:15</span>). I understand
then that Christ in this verse notes a contrast
between the Scriptures and himself; the
Jews search the Scriptures because <em>in them</em> they
think to find eternal life. But eternal life is not
in the <em>Book</em>; it is in the <em>person</em> to whom the
Book bears witness. And they search in vain
who do not find in it the Christ to whom the
Book bears testimony. In contrast with their
searching, note the spirit and method of the
Bereans, who searched to see <cite>if these things were
so</cite> (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 17:10, 11</span>), that is, with a docile and inquiring,
not a predetermined mind.—&#8203;<b>Ye will not
come unto me.</b> Though the Scriptures which
they searched so diligently contained testimony
to a suffering and saving Messiah, they would
not come to him. They were as one who reads
a guide-board, but goes not whither it points.—&#8203;<b>That
ye might have life.</b> The object of
Christ’s coming was to give life; the object of
coming to Christ is to receive life
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch10_10">10:10</a></span>). The

Mosaic writings, see <abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> 31:21, 26.—&#8203;<b>Even

the meaning of <em>in whom</em> (<span lang="el">εἰς ὅν</span>), see 2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 1:10.
<em>In</em> (<span lang="el">εἰς</span>) signifies the end toward which any action
tends; with verbs indicating a mental action,
the object of that action. The hopes of the Jews
looked toward Moses, <i>i. e.</i>, toward an exact obedience
of the letter of the law given by Moses,
not toward a spiritual communion with the Father
whose children they were called to be. For
a portrayal, autobiographically, of this legal and
self-righteous hope, see <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 3:4-6.—&#8203;<b>Had ye
believed Moses.</b> Not believed <em>in</em> or <em>on</em> him;
the child of God believes the prophets, he believes

really believed Moses, even as a teacher, they
would have believed <em>on</em> Christ; for Moses testified
of Christ.—&#8203;<b>For he wrote of me.</b> An
incidental testimony to the Mosaic authorship of
the books usually attributed by the Jews to
Moses, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, the first five books of the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>; also
an indication of the prophetic and typical character
of the ceremonial law. Moses was a prophet
because the entire <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> ceremonial and <span style="white-space:nowrap;">service—temple</span>
sacrifices, ablutions, etc.—&#8203;were prophecies,
fulfilled in and by Christ. Thus Christ
himself incidentally confirms that view of the
<abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> ceremonial which underlies and is most
fully expounded by the Epistle to the Hebrews.—&#8203;<b>But
if ye believe not his writings, how
shall ye believe my words?</b> “The meaning
is, Men give greater weight to what is written
and published, the letter of a book, than to mere

you hallowed by the reverence of ages, how can
you believe the words which are uttered by <em>Me</em>,

reach the <em>end</em>?’ If your unbelief has stopped
the path, how shall ye arrive at Him to whom it

<p><abbr title="Chapter">Ch.</abbr> 6:1-15. FEEDING OF THE FIVE THOUSAND.—&#8203;<span class="smcap">The
grace, the bounty, the power, and the
method of Christ illustrated.</span></p>

<p>Of this miracle accounts are given by the four
Evangelists (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 14:13-33; Mark 6:32-52; Luke 9:10-17</span>);
and it is the only miracle recorded by them all.
There are some differences in their records; for
details see notes below. In the main the three
Synoptics agree, while the differences between
them and the Fourth Gospel are more considerable.
According to the Synoptics Jesus and his
disciples crossed the Sea of Galilee to the east
side; the people, going round by land, outran
them, and apparently were waiting for them on
the shore (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark</span>); Christ therefore abandoned his
original design of rest, and devoted the day to
instruction (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark</span>) and healing (<span class="muchsmaller">Matthew and Luke</span>).
When evening was come the disciples asked him
to send the people away to the villages to get
necessary food; Jesus replied, Give ye them to
eat; the disciples answered that they had nothing
but five loaves and two small fishes to give;
and from these Jesus fed them. According to
John, Jesus crossed over the sea with his disciples,
went up into the hills, and there sat with
them; while sitting there he saw the people
coming round by land, proposed to feed them,
asked Philip where they should get the bread,
and apparently going down to the plain to feed
the people, took the five loaves and two small
fishes and distributed them among the people.
All agree, however, as to the main facts: the
feeding of five thousand on five loaves and two
small fishes, and the gathering of twelve baskets
of fragments, are narrated by all four Evangelists;
the subsequent departure of Christ into the
mountain for solitude and prayer, the embarkation
of the disciples by boat, and his walking to

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
them upon the sea are recounted by all but Luke;
Matthew alone gives the account of Peter’s attempt
to walk upon the water to meet Jesus.
Harmonists have endeavored to combine these
accounts in one consistent narrative; this is the
work, however, rather of imagination than of
criticism; any such harmony is necessarily hypothetical.
The attempts have succeeded in so far
as to show that the accounts are capable of combination.
It may be added that the variations
are just such as we might expect in narratives
coming from independent eye-witnesses, and not
such as we might expect in different fictitious
accounts, or in different versions of a myth, derived
from the same tradition. The miracle
took place immediately on the return of the
twelve after executing the commissions given
to them in Matthew, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 10; the immediate object
of Christ in retiring to the eastern shore of
the Sea of Galilee was to secure quiet for a personal
conference with the twelve respecting their
work (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 6:30</span>). For further statement of the
chronology of the event, and the most probable
harmony of the four accounts, see <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 14:13-27,
note. A topographical difficulty is presented
by an apparent but not real inconsistency
between Luke 9:10 and Mark 6:45. According
to Luke, Christ took the twelve with him into a
desert place belonging to Bethsaida, whither the
multitude followed him; according to Mark,
after feeding the multitude he told the twelve
to sail across to the other side unto Bethsaida.
Thus Luke seems to place Bethsaida on the eastern,
and Mark on the western shore of the lake,
and this has led to the hypothesis that there
were two Bethsaidas, an hypothesis generally
adopted by the commentators, without, it seems
to me, sufficient inquiry. It has no historical
confirmation, was invented to harmonize Luke
and Mark, and is needless. Let the reader compare
the map of the Sea of Galilee (<abbr title="Volume One">Vol. I</abbr>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
342) with the accompanying illustration, in which
he looks down on the Sea of Galilee from the
north. The ruins in the foreground are those of
Bethsaida; the river is the Jordan. Probably in
ancient times the town of Bethsaida reached to
or near the shore of the lake. The mountains in
the distance are those on the eastern shore of
Galilee, and the plain at their foot is the plain of
Butaiha, where the five thousand were fed.
Christ was at or near Capernaum; sailed with
his disciples across the Sea of Galilee to the plain
of Butaiha, at the foot of the hills on the northeastern
shore of the lake, not far from Bethsaida.
After the attempt of the multitude to make
Jesus king, he bade them embark and row along
the shore toward (<span lang="el">πρός</span>) Bethsaida (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 6:45</span>),
where he proposed to meet them. A sudden
wind rising and blowing down the Jordan valley
from the Lebanon range (<span class="muchsmaller">see on verses 16-18</span>), drove
the disciples’ boat out into the lake; and it was
while they were rowing back, against the wind,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
toward Bethsaida, where their Lord had promised
to meet them, that he came out upon the
waves for that purpose. Thus it is true that
when they left Capernaum for the plain of Butaiha
in the morning, they were going over to a
plain belonging to the city of Bethsaida, as Luke
reports; and also true that when they started
back in the evening in the direction of Capernaum,
as John reports (<abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 17, <span lang="el">εἰς</span> indicating the
ultimate point they had in view), they were also
going toward Bethsaida, which lay on the northern
shore, and not far from midway between the
eastern and the western shores. See further,
Mark 6:45, note.</p>

<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 342. The eastern shore was not populous; it
is to this day comparatively a solitude; Christ
went thither with his disciples partly for rest and
a quiet conference (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 6:30, 31</span>), and partly in
consequence of the death of John the Baptist,
perhaps to avoid the possibility of danger to himself
and to them from Herod. After the sermon
which followed this miracle of feeding, reported
in this chapter by John, he engaged no more in
any public ministry in Galilee. See <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 15:29-39,
note.—&#8203;<b>Because they saw his miracles
which he did.</b> John has not recorded
any miracles done at this time in Galilee, and
only two performed at any time in Galilee. This
is one of those incidental references which makes
it clear to my mind that John wrote not only
with a personal knowledge of the writings of the
other Evangelists or some of them, but with a
recognition of the fact that their writings would
be familiar to the readers of his own Gospel.
The miracles referred to here are those performed
in Christ’s Galilean ministry subsequent
to his return from the second Passover at Jerusalem.

<p><b>3, 4. And Jesus went up into the hill
country.</b> Up from the shore of the sea to the
quiet of the hills. These, on the eastern shore,
rise to a height of nearly 2,000 feet above the
level of the sea, which is however itself depressed
some 600 feet below the level of the Mediterranean.—&#8203;<b>The
Passover, a feast of the Jews,
was nigh.</b> This affords both a note of time
and an explanation of the multitude present.
The month was Nizan (our March). The grass
was green; the trees were in full leaf; the palm
trees were laden with blossoms; the orange and
lemon trees with fruit; the barley was ripening
in the fields. At such a season and in such a
climate, to spend a night without shelter is no
hardship, and is not unusual. The leisure of the
Oriental is partly a characteristic of the people,
partly an incident of a climate which compels
less labor than ours. The fifteen days preceding
the Passover were largely devoted to various
preparations for it; the roads, streets, and
bridges were repaired, and the caravans began
to move toward Jerusalem. The gathering at
such a time of a congregation of 5,000 men, besides
women and children, attracted by the fame
of such a prophet, is not at all incredible. The
reader must also remember that Galilee was then
the home of a large population. According to
Josephus, there were six cities of considerable
size on the thirteen miles of coast-line along the
northern and northeastern shores of the Lake
of Tiberias.</p>

them there upon his arrival (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 6:33</span>). There is
no irreconcilable inconsistency in the two statements.
It may be that Jesus found a few of his
disciples, those that knew his probable destination,
and took them up with him and the twelve
into the hills; for the term <em>disciples</em> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch6_3">3</a></span>) is not
in the Gospels confined to the twelve apostles;
that the larger multitude followed, looking for
the Lord; and that their gradual congregating
moved his compassion (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 6:34</span>) and led him to
descend from the retirement of the hills to teach
and to heal them.—&#8203;<b>He saith unto Philip.</b>
He spent the greater part of the day in teaching
and healing (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 14:14; Mark 6:34; Luke 9:11</span>). The
people, absorbed by their interest, took no note
of the passage of time. As the afternoon drew
on, the disciples proposed to Christ to send the
people away to procure food (<span class="muchsmaller">Matthew, Mark, Luke</span>);
it was probably as a result of this proposition

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
that Christ addressed to Philip the question
here, Whence shall we buy? This question is
reported alone by John. Why did Jesus address
this inquiry to Philip? Some commentators have
supposed that he was the purveyor for Christ
and the apostles; others that his faith was especially
weak and needed strengthening; still
others that the question was addressed to him
because he belonged to Bethsaida (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch1_44">1:44</a></span>), and
therefore would be the one to know where food
could be procured; but there is no evidence to
support either hypothesis. Christ frequently
questioned his disciples in order to bring out to
their own consciousness the measure of their
faith (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 9:28; 16:13; 19:17; Luke 24:17, etc.</span>).—&#8203;<b>For
he himself knew what he would do.</b> A
statement made by the apostle to emphasize the
truth that Jesus himself was not in perplexity,
and taking counsel with his apostles for his own
guidance. This he is never recorded to have
done. According to Matthew the question of
providing for the multitude was not raised until
“it was evening” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 14:15</span>). Yet both Matthew
and John say that “when evening was come”
Jesus was left alone in the mountain (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 16; <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
14:23</span>). The explanation of this discrepancy lies
in the fact that there were two evenings recognized
by the Hebrews, as by the Greeks, one beginning
with the declining sun at or about three
in the afternoon, the other with the setting sun.
It was during the first evening, <i>i. e.</i>, between
three and six, that the people were fed; at the
second evening, <i>i. e.</i>, about sunset, they had departed
and left Jesus alone.</p>

<p><b>7-9. Two hundred pennyworth of bread.</b>
The penny, or denarius, was equal in value to
seventeen cents American coin; but it was the
day’s wages of a common laborer (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 20:2</span>);
two hundred pennyworth therefore would be
practically equivalent to $200 worth in our time.—&#8203;<b>One
of his disciples said unto him.</b>
Christ bade them ascertain how much they had
on hand for themselves (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 6:38</span>). Andrew ascertained
and reported in response to Christ’s
direction. The lad here mentioned was therefore
probably some one in attendance upon
Christ and the twelve, and carrying their simple
store for them. How much blessing the Lord
can impart to the service of a little child. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>
2 Kings 5:2, 3. Here a <em>little boy</em> (<span lang="el">παιδάριον</span>) had
but five loaves, and they of barley, and yet when
given to the Lord, and blessed by Him, they
feed five thousand.—&#8203;<b>Five barley loaves.</b> The
loaves of the Jews were thin round cakes or
crackers; for illustration and description, see
Mark 8:3-5, note. Barley was the food only of
the lower classes. “One in the Talmud, speaking
of barley bread, says, ‘There is a fine crop
of barley.’ Another answers, ‘Tell this to the
horses and asses.’ A Roman soldier who had
quitted his ranks, had for part of his punishment
that he received barley bread instead of wheaten.”—(<cite>Geike’s
Life of Christ.</cite>) Thus we have
here (1) an indication of the simplicity of the
living of our Lord; without a place to lay his
head, <i>i. e.</i>, a permanent home, and with the
plainest possible food for his fare, the bread of
the peasant classes; (2) a suggestion of true benevolence;
he did not create wheaten bread for
the multitude; he gave such as he had. To
share what we have, not to aspire to give what
we have not, is true benevolence.—&#8203;<b>And two
small fishes.</b> The word here rendered <em>small
fishes</em> (<span lang="el">ὀψύριον</span>) denotes any relish eaten with
bread; hence, because fish was a common accompaniment,
the most common from the animal
kingdom, it came to be used for fish, generally
salt fish, prepared for and used as a relish.</p>


<div class="p2 blockquote">

<p><b>10, 11. Make the men sit down.</b> It requires
little imagination to picture to the mind
the wondering surprise with which the disciples
prepared to obey a direction the object of which
they could not conceive, and the perplexity of
the people as they prepared to take their places,
wondering what was to occur next. They sat
down; Mark tells us <em>in ranks</em>, literally <dfn>garden
plats</dfn> (<span lang="el">πρασιαὶ πρασιαὶ</span>; the repetition without
<span lang="el">καί</span> denotes distribution). With their bright-colored
Oriental dresses, these men sitting cross-legged
on the ground in groups of fifty each
(<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 6:40</span>), so that their number was afterward
easily estimated, presented an appearance which
recalled a brilliant garden in the early summer.
The picture thus presented by Mark, but lost in
our English translation, is one of the pictorial
characteristics of his Gospel, and is thought to
have been derived by him from Peter, the
most effective and therefore probably the most
pictorial of all the apostolic preachers.—&#8203;<b>There
was much grass in the place.</b> This is not
inconsistent with its description by the other
Evangelists as a <em>desert</em> place, the word desert
implying simply solitude, not an arid soil. The
location (<cite>Thompson’s Land and Book</cite>, <abbr title="Volume Two">Vol. II</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
29) was probably the rich level plain of Butaiha,
forming a triangle, of which the Eastern mountains

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
make one side and the lake shore and the
Jordan the other two. It was at the southeastern
angle of this plain, near the point where the
hills abut upon the lake, that the feeding took
place. “From the four narratives of this stupendous
miracle we gather: 1st, that the place
belonged to Bethsaida; 2d, that it was a desert
place; 3d, that it was near the shore of the lake,
for they came to it by boats; 4th, that there was
a mountain close at hand; 5th, that it was a
smooth, grassy spot, capable of seating many
thousand people. Now all these requisites are
found in this exact locality, and nowhere else, so
far as I can discover. This Butaiha belonged to
Bethsaida. At this extreme southeast corner of
it the mountain shuts down upon the lake, bleak
and barren. It was, doubtless, desert then as
now, for it is not capable of cultivation. In this
little cove the ships (boats) were anchored. On
this beautiful sward, at the base of the rocky
hill, the people were seated.”—(<cite>Andrews.</cite>)—<b>About
five thousand.</b> Besides women and
children (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 14:21</span>), who perhaps sat separately
from the men, as Oriental custom would require
them to do.—&#8203;<b>When he had given thanks.</b>
The same act is differently expressed by the
other Evangelists as blessing the bread. Asking
a blessing upon food before meals was a universal
custom among the Jews, and was practised
both by Christ and by the apostles (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 22:17, 19;
24:30; Acts 27:35</span>).—&#8203;<b>He gave [to the disciples
and the disciples] to them that were set
down.</b> The words which I have put in brackets
are not in the original according to the best manuscripts.
They have been added from <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
14:19. They undoubtedly represent the actual
fact, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, that the bread was distributed by the
hands of the twelve.</p>

<p><b>12-15. Gather up the fragments that
remain, that nothing be lost.</b> “It was a
custom and a rule (among the Jews) that when
they ate together they should leave something
to those that served. ‘Every one leaves a little
portion in the dish, which is called the servitor’s
part.’”—(<cite>Lightfoot.</cite>) The fragments thus gathered
up by the apostles were probably preserved
for their own use. The practical lesson is important:
“He likewise exhorts his disciples to frugality
when he says, ‘Gather the fragments which
are left, that nothing be lost’; for the increase
of the bounty of God ought not to be an excitement
to luxury. Let those therefore who have
abundance remember that they will one day render
an account of their immoderate wealth, if
they do not carefully and faithfully apply their
superfluity to purposes which are good, and of
which God approves.”—(<cite>Calvin.</cite>) This gathering
up of the fragments demonstrates also the
reality of the miracle. See below.—&#8203;<b>They filled
twelve baskets</b> (<span lang="el">κοφίνος</span>). These baskets were
the common baskets used universally by the
Jews in traveling to carry their food. See for
description and illustration, <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 16:9, 10, note.
Christ there distinguishes between this miracle
and that of the feeding of the 4,000, which are evidently
not to be confounded as one event.—&#8203;<b>That
prophet that should come into the world.</b>
Foretold in <abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> 18:15, 16, and referred to by
the delegation sent from Jerusalem to inquire of
John the Baptist as to his character and authority
(<span class="muchsmaller">John 1:21</span>). By some Rabbis this prophet was
regarded as a forerunner of the Messiah; by
others as the Messiah himself. Here apparently
the people regarded the two as identical; this at
least is indicated by their desire to take Christ at
once and crown him as king.—&#8203;<b>Jesus knowing
that they were about to come and seize
him that they might make him king.</b>
Either by reading in their hearts the half-formed
design; or perceiving it in their whispered conference;
or informed of it by the apostles, who
doubtless shared the enthusiasm of the multitude,
and who may have been as eager as any for
the coronation of their Lord. This attempt of
the people to make Christ a temporal king was
a renewal of Satan’s endeavor to tempt him to
secure the kingdoms of the earth by Satanic
methods (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 4:8-10, note</span>). The Jews anticipated
a realm of material marvels and miracles with
the advent of the Messiah. “Drought and famine
should then be known no more. The prophecy
of Isaiah (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 65:13</span>), ‘My servants shall eat,
but ye shall be hungry,’ should be literally fulfilled.
Israel should be gathered together. The
young men should feed on bread, the old men on
honey, the children on oil. Every palate should
be pleased, every appetite satisfied, and the prolific
profusion of the Garden of Eden should repeat
itself in the land of the Messiah. These
prophecies of the scribes, with which constant

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
repetition in the synagogue had made the common
people familiar, seemed to them about to be
fulfilled.”—(<cite>Abbott’s Jesus of Nazareth.</cite>)—<b>He departed
again into the mountain.</b> For solitude
and prayer (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 14:23; Mark 6:46</span>). He first
constrained his disciples to embark for Bethsaida,
a fact which Matthew and Mark state (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
14:22; Mark 6:45</span>) without giving the reason for
it; John alone tells of the purpose of the multitude
to make Christ a king. There is significance
for us in Christ’s refusal of their homage.
They desired to <em>make</em> him king, not to accept
him as king; to give him a sceptre, not to own
allegiance to the sceptre he possessed; to secure
his power and authority in aid of their designs,
not to recognize his royal authority and be obedient
to his will. When they found out what
that will involved, from his discourse on the
following Sabbath at Capernaum, they would
have him for their king no longer. It is one
thing to attempt to make Christ serve our wills;
it is a very different thing to make our wills obedient
to his.</p>

<p>Various attempts have been made to explain
this miracle on rationalistic principles. The two
principal explanations offered are: (1) that the
people were so satisfied with Christ’s instruction
that they did not feel the claims of hunger
(<cite>Schenkel</cite>); (2) that they had their hearts opened
by the beneficence of Christ, so that those who
possessed food themselves provided for those
that had none, and thus all were furnished by a
miracle of love, operating not by the literal creation
of new supplies, but by the inspiration of a
new spirit of benevolence in the people themselves.
This, if I understand him aright, is
Lange’s explanation. See his <cite>Life of Christ</cite>, <abbr title="Volume Two">Vol.
II</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 140. For a more elaborate classification of
rationalistic theories, see <cite>Lange’s Commentary on
Matthew</cite>, <abbr title="American edition">Am. ed.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 266. Neither interpretation
deserves serious refutation. The first is inconsistent
with the fact that twelve baskets of the
fragments were gathered up after the meal was
ended; the second is contradicted by the language
of the disciples, who plainly imply that
the people are without food (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 14:15; Mark 6:36;
Luke 9:12</span>), and by the enthusiasm of the people
after the miracle has been performed. They
were not of a kind to be ready to crown a prophet
as king, merely because he had opened their
hearts and inclined them to benevolence. It is,
however, to be noted that here as elsewhere the
Evangelists simply state the facts, leaving the
reader to make his own deductions. These facts
are that over 5,000 people were upon a plain,
without provisions; that all the food which
Christ had for them was five loaves and two
small fishes; that he distributed this to the
twelve, and they to the multitude; that all had
enough; and that when the meal was over there
were twelve baskets full of fragments remaining.
Assuming these to be the facts, the explanation
of a miraculous creation of bread is the only reasonable
explanation; any other hypothesis impugns
the historical verity of the four Gospels.
The attempt to explain the miracle as an acceleration
of the processes of nature (<cite>Olshausen</cite>), to
which, as Dr. Schaff well says, “must be added
an accelerated process of art, or the combined
labors of the reaper, miller, and baker,” gives no
help in understanding the process by which
Christ provided for all. We can accept the fact
without comprehending the method, which is
indeed as entirely incomprehensible as are God’s
methods in the ordinary phenomena of nature,
<i>e. g.</i>, the multiplication of a single kernel of corn
into the many kernels upon the stalk. The parallel
and contrast between this miracle and the
analogous but different multiplication of food
wrought by the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> prophets Elijah and Elisha
(<span class="muchsmaller">1 Kings 17:16; 2 Kings 4:42-44</span>) are instructive. Like
all of Christ’s miracles, this multiplication is a
parable. (1) It illustrates Christ’s method: the
way to men’s hearts is often through ministering
to their bodies; in the recent famines in India
and China (1877), the missionaries have found the
way opened for the gospel in many districts by
their ability to provide the starving with food or
employment. (2) It manifests the miraculous
grace of God: “everything wastes in the hands
of men; but everything multiplies in those of
the Son of God.”—(<cite>Quesnel.</cite>) (3) It rebukes distrust:
“He who feeds here five thousand men
in an extraordinary manner and by a visible miracle,
cannot He find means to support this numerous
family, which raises in the mind of this
father and mother so many unceasing and distrustful
thoughts?”—(<cite>Quesnel.</cite>) (4) It is an
inspiration and a prophecy of Christian love. It
is “the brilliant inauguration of that fruitful
miracle of Christian charity which has ever since
gone on, multiplying bread to the hungry. The
heart of man once touched, like the rock in the
desert touched by the rod of Moses, has gone on
pouring over thirsty crowds the inexhaustible
stream of generosity.”—(<cite>Pressense.</cite>) (5) It is a
symbol of the inexhaustible love of Christ himself;
a symbol of that miraculous multiplying of
sacred influences which, from one brief life of
three active years, and one body pierced and
broken on the tree, feeds innumerable thousands,
a love which Christ imparts to his disciples, and
which they in turn convey throughout the ages
and to all lands.</p>

the sea.</b> From the plain where the five thousand
had been fed. By the disciples here is
meant the apostles. They went reluctantly,
yielding to Christ. This is implied by the language
of Matthew and Mark, he “constrained
his disciples.” While they departed by sea Jesus
sent the multitude away.—&#8203;<b>And entered
into a ship.</b> A fishing-boat; large enough to
carry Christ and the twelve; not too large to be
propelled by oars. See for description, Mark 6:36,
note.—&#8203;<b>And went over the sea unto Capernaum</b>
(<span lang="el">εἰς Κ.</span>). Mark says <cite>toward Bethsaida</cite>
(<span lang="el">πρός β.</span>). John indicates the final aim of their
journey; Mark the direction in which the boat
was steered. They started <em>for</em> Capernaum <i lang="la">via</i>
Bethsaida. See <abbr title="Preliminary">Prel.</abbr> Note <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">above</a>, and Mark 6:45,
note.—&#8203;<b>Jesus was not come to them.</b>
An evidence that they expected to meet him
along the shore; probably (this is implied upon
a comparison of the three gospel narratives) at
Bethsaida, <i>i. e.</i>, at or near the entrance of the
Jordan upon the lake.—&#8203;<b>The sea arose by reason
of a great wind that blew.</b> It is a common
occurrence for the winds to arise suddenly
upon this lake, drawing down the Jordan valley
from the Lebanon range in the north. See Mark
4:37, note. “My experience in this region enables
me to sympathize with the disciples in their
long night’s contest with the wind. I spent a
night in that wady Shukaiyif, some three miles
up it, to the left of us. The sun had scarcely
set when the wind began to rush down toward
the lake, and it continued all night long with
constantly increasing violence, so that when we
reached the shore the next morning the face of
the lake was like a huge boiling caldron. The wind
howled down every wady from the northeast and
east with such fury that no efforts of rowers
could have brought a boat to shore at any point
along that coast. In a wind like that the disciples
<em>must</em> have been driven quite across to Gennesaret,
as we know they were. To understand
the causes of these sudden and violent tempests,
we must remember that the lake lies <span style="white-space:nowrap;">low—six</span>
hundred feet lower than the ocean; that the
vast and naked plateaus of the Jordan rise to a
great height, spreading backward to the wilds
of the Hauran, and upward to snowy Hermon;
that the water-courses have cut out profound
ravines and wild gorges, converging to the head
of this lake, and that these act like gigantic <em>funnels</em>
to draw down the cold winds from the
mountains.”—(<cite>Thompson’s Land and Book</cite>, 2:32.)
Dr. Thompson adds a testimony to the suddenness
with which these winds arise: “I once went
in to swim near the hot baths, and before I was
aware a wind came rushing over the cliffs with
such force that it was with great difficulty I
could regain the shore.”</p>

that is, a little over three miles. The lake
at this point is about six miles across; they had
therefore rowed about half way across the lake;
but they were unable to make head against the

keep their appointment with Jesus. <em>It was while
they were endeavoring to come to Jesus that he came
out upon the sea to meet them.</em>—<b>They see Jesus
walking on the sea.</b> That he was really
walking on the sea, not standing on the land and
supposed to be on the sea because only dimly
discerned through the storm and darkness
(<cite>Bleek</cite>), is evident from the facts, (1) that Peter
went out to meet him (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 14:28-31</span>); (2) that on
receiving him into the ship they were immediately
at the land “unto which they were going”
(<span lang="el">εἰς ἣν ὑπῆγον</span>). This was the plain of Gennesaret,
on which Capernaum was situated, and was
two or three miles away from the point where
they met Jesus; for they had as yet rowed only
about half the distance across the lake.—&#8203;<b>He
saith unto them, It is I.</b> Literally, <dfn>I am</dfn>.
The same language used by Jesus in Jerusalem
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>

stoned him, and in the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> to designate Jehovah
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> 3:14</span>). Here I should prefer to give it
this meaning. Christ says not merely, “It is I,
your Friend and Master;” he says, at least implies,
It is the “I am” who is coming to you,
the Almighty One who rules winds and waves,
who made them, and whom they obey.—&#8203;<b>Be not
afraid.</b> This is the message of Christ to his people
in the hour of his advent (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 2:10</span>); of their tempest
experiences of temptation and struggle (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
14:27; Mark 6:50; 1 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 3:14</span>); their sorrows (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 28:10;
Mark 5:36</span>); and their hour of dangerous duty (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts
18:9</span>).—&#8203;<b>Then they willingly received him.</b>
Literally, <em>Thereupon they willed to receive him</em>. If

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
this account stood alone we might perhaps
doubt whether he actually did enter the ship, as
some rationalistic commentators have done; but
Matthew and Mark are explicit in their statements
that he did so.—&#8203;<b>And immediately the
ship was at the land to which they were
going.</b> That is, the shore at Capernaum. This,
coupled with the statement of <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch6_19">19</a> that they
had only rowed twenty-five or thirty furlongs, <i>i. e.</i>,
about half way, seems clearly to imply a further
miracle, unless indeed we give to the word <em>immediately</em>
(<span lang="el">εὐθέως</span>) a large latitude of expression, understanding
it merely to mean that since the wind
at once ceased (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 14:32</span>) they had no further
difficulty in reaching their destination. Matthew
adds that they that were in the ship came and
worshipped Jesus, saying, “Of a truth thou art
the Son of God;” and Mark that they were
amazed beyond measure, “for they considered
not the miracle of the loaves, for their heart was
hardened,” rather <em>dull, stupid</em>. They had been
amazed at the miracle of the loaves, but they
had not deduced from it the natural conclusion
that Christ was the Lord of nature, so when a
new manifestation of his power was made they
were as much surprised as if they had never seen
any previous manifestation. In this they were
very typical of Christians in all ages of the
church.</p>

<p class="p2"><abbr title="Chapter">Ch.</abbr> 6:22-71. SERMON ON THE BREAD OF LIFE.—&#8203;<span class="smcap">The
condition of eternal life: feeding on
Christ.—&#8203;The true nature of faith symbolized.—&#8203;The
meaning of the Lord’s Supper.</span></p>

<p><a id="Note6_22"></a><span class="smcap">Preliminary Note.</span>—Before entering upon this
discourse in detail, some preliminary considerations
are necessary. 1. <i>The report.</i> There is no reason
to believe that we have a verbatim report of
Christ’s discourse, but good reason to believe the
reverse. John makes no claim to give the sermon
in full. The language of <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch6_59">59</a> implies that he
does not. The whole sermon occupies in deliberate
reading less than five minutes. We can
hardly suppose that an actual discourse delivered
in the synagogue would have been compressed
in so brief a space. We have then,
here, John’s subsequent report written out from
memory, though from memory quickened by
divine inspiration, of a discourse very much
longer than the report. It embodies in John’s
language the substance of Christ’s thoughts.
2. <i>The circumstances and connection.</i> After
the feeding of the 5,000, the apostles embark
in their boat; Christ goes up into the hills
to pray; the people linger a while for his return,
then conclude that he has returned to Capernaum,
and go back to Capernaum themselves;
on the following Sabbath morning he enters the
synagogue; their astonishment at his approach
is great; they break out in questioning, How did
you get here? His answer diverts them from
mere astonishment to a serious consideration of
spiritual truth: “Ye are seeking me, not because
of the evidence I have given of my divine
commission, but because ye did eat of the loaves
and were filled. Labor not for the meat that
perisheth, but for that meat which endureth
unto everlasting life.” Their response indicates
some seriousness of desire: “What is the work
which God would have us to do that we might
have this bread of life as our reward?” This is
the question of all religious aspiration, and
Christ’s answer is the response of Christianity to
the soul-hunger of the ages: “This is the work
of God, that ye have faith in him whom he hath
sent.” This I believe to be the text of the sermon
which follows; it gives the subject; it is
the key to its mysticism. The object of the discourse
is to give Christ’s definition and interpretation
of faith. This definition appears and reappears,
first in metaphor, then in interpretation:
My Father is giving you the true bread, which
is coming down from heaven. I am the bread of
life; he that cometh to me shall never hunger;
he that believeth on me shall never thirst. This
coming is not a literal physical coming; it is a
coming of the spirit; a coming drawn by divine
influence; a coming of those who are taught of
God. To thus believe in me, to thus eat my
flesh and drink my blood, is to have everlasting
life; for to thus eat my flesh and
drink my blood is to dwell in me and have
in me an indwelling life. Finally, to guard
his followers against that literalism which has
since converted this metaphor into a stone of
stumbling and a rock of offence, Christ adds to
his discourse the decisive words of <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch6_63">63</a>, “It
is the Spirit that quickeneth, <em>the flesh</em> profiteth
nothing; the words that I speak unto you, they
are spirit and they are life.” 3. <i>Meaning of the
metaphor.</i> I believe then that the key to the
metaphors of this sermon is to be found in the
question and answer of verses 28, 29; that it is
Christ’s metaphorical interpretation of the declaration
that faith is a condition of spiritual life;
that it is mystical, because experience is always
mystical except to those that know it experimentally;
that it is expressed in metaphor, because
a spiritual experience can never be expressed
in any other way; and that Christ has
emphasized the importance of the metaphor by
subsequently making it a permanent symbol in
the Lord’s Supper. To eat his flesh and drink his
blood is to have faith in him, to come unto him;
to partake of his character and imbibe his spirit
(<span class="muchsmaller">verses <a href="#ch6_35">35</a>, <a href="#ch6_40">40</a>, <a href="#ch6_47">47</a>, <a href="#ch6_54">54</a>, <a href="#ch6_57">57</a></span>). Faith, according to Christ,
is not then merely believing what is revealed in
the Word (<cite>Westminster Confession</cite>); nor merely
receiving what God says to be true and resting
on it (<cite>George Muller</cite>); it is feeding on Christ.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
It is interpreted (<i>a</i>) by the physical phenomenon
of eating and drinking. The food enters into us,
becomes a part of us; builds us up; makes us
what we are; different food going to different
parts of the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">body—some</span> to brain, others to muscle,
etc.; different natures and different avocations
needing different food. It is Christ <em>in</em> us
who is the hope of glory. (<i>b</i>) By our own use of
the same metaphor. We recognize in common
language a higher than mere physical feeding;
other gateways to the nature than the mouth
and the stomach; other means that modify, develop,
and make the character. Men are made
by what they receive through interior faculties.
So Christ’s metaphor constantly reappears in the
language of our common life; we drink in a picture;
imbibe ideas; devour books; <i>e. g.</i>,</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">(<i>c</i>) By the Rabbinical use of the metaphor, common
in Christ’s time, and well understood by the
Jews. “There is nothing more common in the
schools of the Jews than the phrases of eating
and drinking in a metaphorical sense.”—(<cite>Lightfoot.</cite>)
“To eat of my bread” was a phrase
equivalent to partake of my doctrine. Christ
borrows a common metaphor to emphasize a
deeper truth; to have faith in him is not to “eat
of my bread,” but to “eat of my flesh;” that
is, it is to receive not merely the influence of
Christ’s teaching, but yet more that of his life
and character itself, an influence which could be
imparted to the world only through his passion
and death, through the literal rending of his flesh
and shedding of his blood. (<i>d</i>) By the experience
of faith in a lower sphere, our faith in each
other. The highest faith of a child in his mother
is not believing something about her, nor merely
believing what she says; it includes an intellectual
belief that she is his mother, and a filial
trust in her, but it also includes such a reverence
for her, an uplooking to her, an admiration of
her, a feeding upon her, that all her best characteristics
are reproduced in the worshipping child.
So the character of the best teachers ever reproduces
itself in the character of their admiring
pupils. (<i>e</i>) By the actual record of the experience
of faith contained in the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> and the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
(<i>e. g.</i>, <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 42:5, 11; 63:5-8; 73:23-26; 2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 3:18; <abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr></span>
<span class="muchsmaller">2:20; <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 3:8-14</span>). (<i>f</i>) By other metaphors in the
<abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> in which Christ is compared to a way on
which we walk, a garment which we are to put
on, a vine on which we are to be engrafted, a
husband to whom we are to be married, a head
from which we as a body are to derive all our
life, the ground in which we are to be rooted,
the foundation on which we are to be built, and
the Spirit which is to dwell in us as in a temple.
Faith in Christ then, as defined by Christ himself,
if I have rightly interpreted this discourse, <em>is not
belief about him, nor trust in him, but appropriation
of him</em>. It is not mere belief in what the Bible
teaches respecting him, though it is certainly
founded on historical Christianity; it is not mere
trust in his word or power or grace, though it involves
the highest personal trust in him as a divine
and gracious Saviour. It is making him the soul’s
spiritual aliment, following after him, coming to
him, dwelling in him, so drinking in his words,
life, and spirit as to be conformed to his image.
The soul enters into eternal, that is spiritual life,
not by believing any teaching respecting Christ,
not by trusting that Christ will bestow that life,
but by so fastening its love and aspirations and
desires upon Christ that he becomes the All and
in all to the soul, and at once the model for and
modeler of its future and final character.</p>

<p><b>25. And when they had found him.</b>
The greater part of the discourse which follows
was apparently delivered in the synagogue
(<abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch6_29">29</a>),
and presumptively on the Sabbath day.
Maurice supposes that “the conversation commences
on the borders of the lake of Tiberias,
with the people who had just crossed and found
Jesus there,” and is afterward continued in the
synagogue, and he makes the synagogue discourse
commence with <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch6_43">43</a>. This is certainly
possible, though I should think it more probable,
from the close connection between the beginning
and close of the colloquy as reported, that all
occurred at one time and in the synagogue. It
is not at all incredible that such interruptions as
are here reported should have occurred in the
synagogue service.—&#8203;<b>Rabbi, when camest
thou thither?</b> “The question <em>when</em> includes
<em>how</em>.”—(<cite>Bengel.</cite>) Wordsworth’s comment on the
mysterious manner in which Christ crossed the
sea and presented himself in the synagogue affords
a curious illustration of the allegorizing
method which he pursues throughout in dealing
with this chapter. “By walking on the sea, invisibly
to the eyes of the multitude, and suddenly
presenting himself to them in the synagogue
at Capernaum, in a manner unintelligible to
them, he instructs us that, though he does indeed
come by water in holy baptism, and is
verily and indeed present in the holy eucharist,
yet the <em>manner</em> of his presence is not to be scrutinized
by us. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Let us not speculate
inquisitively into the <em>time</em> and <em>manner</em> in which
he is present in the holy eucharist, but let us
receive him joyfully in our hearts, as the disciples
received him into the ship; and then we
shall soon be at the haven of peace where we
would be.”</p>

See <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:18, note.—&#8203;<b>Ye seek me, not because
ye saw the signs, but because ye ate
of the loaves and were satisfied.</b> Christ
leads the people from the lower to the higher,
from the earthly to the spiritual, making, as was
his wont, a simple incident the text of a deeply
spiritual discourse. See <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 11:7; 16:6; Luke
13:1; 14:7; John 4:10. The meaning here is
this: You are not seeking <em>me</em> because you have
seen and recognized the evidences of my divine
commission, and really desire to put yourselves
under me as your Lord and Master; you are seeking
my <em>gifts</em>, and because you have eaten and
been satisfied. He thus characterizes and impliedly
rebukes those who seek not Christ but
Christ’s, because they want not <em>him</em>, but something
external to himself, which they think he

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
can give them.—&#8203;<b>Busy not yourselves about
the meat which perishes.</b> It is not literally
true that we are not to <em>labor</em> for the meat that
perishes (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 18:3; <abbr title="Ephesians">Eph.</abbr> 4:28; 1 <abbr title="Thessalonians">Thess.</abbr> 4:10-12</span>); it is
true that the meat which perishes is not to be
the object of our life-work (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:24</span>). “If any
be idle and gluttonous, and careth for luxury,
that man worketh for the <em>meat that perisheth</em>.
So, too, if a man by his labor should feed Christ,
and give him drink, and clothe him, who so
senseless and mad as to say that such an one labors
for the meat which perisheth, when there is
for this the promise of the kingdom that is to
come, and of those good things? This meat endureth
forever.”—(<cite>Chrysostom.</cite>) <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> with
Christ’s language here <abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 55:2, to which perhaps
he refers, and John 4:13, 14, where an
analogous metaphor is used to enforce the same
teaching.—&#8203;<b>But about the meat which
abides unto everlasting life.</b> <em>Unto</em> (<span lang="el">εἰς</span>) indicates
the purpose for which it remains, namely,
that it may nourish eternal life, <i>i. e.</i>, the life
which continues unto, not which begins in, eternity;
for eternal life is a present possession (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verses">vers.</abbr>
<a href="#ch6_47">47</a>, <a href="#ch6_54">54</a></span>).
This food abides in us. Chaps. <a href="#ch5_38">5:38</a>;

15; 2 John 2 indicate both what is the meat and
what the abiding of which Christ speaks.—&#8203;<b>Which
the Son of man shall give to you.</b>
The phrase <cite>Son of man</cite> is here, as everywhere in
Christ’s use of it, equivalent to the Messiah (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
10:23, note</span>), and would be so understood by his
hearers. This food of the spiritual life is the <em>gift</em>
of God through the Messiah (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 5:17; 6:23</span>). We
might well wonder that Christ’s characterization
of it here as a gift should not have prevented the
question of the multitude in the following verse,
but for the fact that, despite the explicit teaching
of the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> that eternal life is <em>given</em>, even the
disciples of Christ have ever been seeking to
earn it as wages by labor. Christ says <em>shall give</em>
(future) because the great sacrifice was not yet
offered, and so the unspeakable gift (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 9:15</span>)
was not yet perfected.—&#8203;<b>For Him hath God
the Father sealed.</b> In the East the method
of authenticating a document is not, as with us,
by a signature, but by the impression of a seal
(<span class="muchsmaller">1 Kings 21:8; Esther 3:12; 8:8, 10; <abbr title="Jeremiah">Jer.</abbr> 32:10</span>). The
meaning here then is that Jesus’ commission as
the Messiah of God is authenticated by the Father,
by the works given him to do (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch5_36">John 5:36</a></span>).</p>

<p><b>28. What can we do that we may work

not, What are the works of God which we shall

please God by our works? This is the question
which humanity has ever been asking, repeated
in the pilgrimages and the self-mutilations of the
Oriental religions, in the penances and appointed
prayers of the mediæval religions, and in much
of the so-called Christian activity of modern
Protestantism. This was the question which
Loyola asked by his vigils, and to which Luther
found an answer when, climbing Pilate’s staircase
on his knees, he heard the words, “The
just shall live by faith,” and fled from the religion
of works to that of faith. That the questioners
of Christ were seeking, not guidance to
devout activity, but to divine rewards, is clear
from the sequel (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch6_31">31</a></span>).</p>

<p><b>29. This is the work of God, that ye

They ask respecting the <em>works</em> of God (plural),
he replies concerning the <em>work</em> of God (singular);
they ask what they shall <em>do</em>, he replies <em>have faith</em>;
they ask respecting work to be done <em>for</em> God <em>by</em>
them, he replies that it is a work <em>of</em> God <em>in</em> them
that is required. The condition of eternal life is
not doing any work for God, it is having a work
of God done in ourselves. See <a href="#ch3_5">John 3:5</a>; Titus
3:5-7. The condition of this work is faith in
Christ. The nature of this faith it is the object
of the discourse which follows to explain; it is
certainly not equivalent to belief, and the use of
the word believe is an unfortunate necessity from
the poverty of the English language, which contains
no verb corresponding to the noun faith.
Of this faith I know no better nor more comprehensive
definition than that of Webster’s dictionary,
“That confiding and affectionate belief in
the person and work of Christ which affects the
character and life, and makes the man a true
Christian.” See <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 11:1, and notice that
it is there defined not only as the <em>evidence</em> of
things unseen, <i>i. e.</i>, the power of seeing and
realizing the invisible world, which would include
the imagination, but also as the <em>substance</em>
of things hoped for, which clearly includes the
activity of the desires and affections. The germ
of all Paul’s subsequent teaching of justification
by faith is contained in this one single sentence.
The Epistles are but an amplification of the gospel
as proclaimed by Christ himself. “I know
not where we can find any passage, even in the
writings of the apostles, which says more significantly

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
that all eternal life in men proceeds
from nothing else than faith in Christ.”—(<cite>Schleiermacher.</cite>)</p>

<p><b>30, 31. What therefore doest thou as a
sign that we may see and believe thee?</b>
This response of theirs brings out the contrast
between faith and belief. Christ has said, Believe
in him whom God hath sent; the people,
recognizing his reference to himself, reply, Why
should we believe you? or, as Norton renders it,
“give you credit.” He calls for an affectionate
and confiding belief in his person and work, they
decline to give him simple credence.—&#8203;<b>What
dost thou work?</b> This is not, as Maurice
seems to interpret it, the language of a spiritual
yearning, but, as Alford, Stier, Meyer, the language
of unbelief and opposition, a sarcastic retort
of his own words. “Thou commandest us,”
say they, “to work; what dost thou work thyself?”
This demand, coming so soon after the
feeding of the five thousand, has given rise to
some perplexity, and rationalistic commentators
cite it as an evidence that no such miraculous
feeding took place. If not, why should the people
refer to the manna? The fact is that, though
the five thousand were fed, no explanation was
made to them of the way in which the food was
provided; they were commanded to take their
seats; the barley cakes, the bread of the poorest
peasantry, were distributed among them; they
were doubtless astonished; but no conclusions
were drawn for them, and they were not in the
habit of drawing conclusions for themselves.
When, therefore, on the Sabbath, Christ met in
the synagogue some of those who had been fed,
together with others who had not been present,
nothing was more natural than this demand, impliedly
for both a repetition and an explanation
of the miracle. This is the significance of the
reference to the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> account of the miracle of
the manna, “He gave them bread from heaven
to eat” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 78:24</span>). It was as if they said, The
Psalmist has explicitly pointed out the way in
which the commission of Moses was confirmed;
leave us not in the dark respecting the feeding
of the multitude, which was, indeed, strange,
but which has not been interpreted.—&#8203;There is
also implied a contrast between the work of
Moses and the work of Christ; the manna came
down from heaven, the bread was distributed
upon the earth; the manna was given day by
day as needed for forty years, the bread had
been given but once; the manna was a sweet and
delicate food, “the taste of it like wafers with
honey” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> 16:31</span>), and it was among the rabbinical
prophecies that the Messiah would cause
manna to descend which would please all tastes,
“bread for the young men, honey for the old, oil
for the children;” but the bread which Christ
had distributed was barley bread, the commonest
fare of the poorest people.</p>

<p><b>32, 33. Verily, verily, I say unto you,

The people have referred to the manna as the
authentication of Moses; though they do not in
words refer to him, the spirit of their response
is analogous to that of <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch4_12">4:12</a>, Art thou greater
than our father Jacob? Compare <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_53">8:53</a>.
To this Christ replies (1) that Moses did not give
the manna; it was given by God; Moses had
nothing to do with bestowing it; the Israelites
found it in the morning after the dew had dried
off the ground (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> 16:4, 14</span>). (2) This manna
was not the true bread, but merely a type or
shadow of the spiritual antitype; so the Red
Sea, the rock, the brazen serpent, were mute
prophets of spiritual verities, to be fulfilled
through Christ (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch4_14">4:14</a>, <a href="#ch4_15">15</a>;
1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 10:1-11</span>). (3)
Hence, the bread of God was not a past, historic
gift fulfilled in the days of the wilderness, but a
present and a perpetual gift, which the Father
is ever giving. The practical contrast suggested
is that between the faith which reveres only a
past religion, a providence and an inspiration in
the days of the patriarchs and prophets and
apostles, and that which holds fast to a present
providence, an ever-living Spirit, and a continuous
inspiration, a living bread ever given
throughout all ages.—&#8203;<b>For the bread of God
is that which comes down from the heaven
and gives life to the world.</b> Christ here lays
down a general principle in which he defines the
essential characteristics of God’s spiritual gift.
That alone is the true bread (1) which is evermore
descending from the heavens, a perpetual
bestowment; (2) which bestows life; (3) which
is for the world. The manna did not last over a
single day (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr>
16:19, 20</span>), and finally ceased to
fall when the Israelites entered the Holy Land
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Joshua">Josh.</abbr> 5:12</span>);
they that ate it all died (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch6_49">49</a></span>); and
it was given only to a single nation. The type
was brief in its duration, limited in its effects,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
confined to a few recipients. The antitype is for
all mankind, confers everlasting life, and is bestowed
evermore.</p>

food or means of life from heaven (<cite>Alford</cite>, <cite>Meyer</cite>),
nor with a serious comprehension of his spiritual
meaning and a sincere desire for his spiritual
gift (<cite>Maurice</cite>, <cite>Lucke</cite>). The people were shallow
and superficial; without comprehending the
meaning of Christ’s words, they yet saw in them
the offer of something desirable, they knew not
what, and asked for it. In the minds of some
there may have been a dim sense of the value of
the inner life, such as is sometimes borne in
upon sensual and superficial natures by the mere
power of the presence of a great soul. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>
Luke 14:15. There, as here, Christ by his
teaching rebukes the superficial and ignorant
desire for an uncomprehended blessedness;
there, by showing parabolically how the spiritual
food is declined by those to whom it is
offered; here, by interpreting the nature of spiritual
food. The rejection of Christ by the people
here, illustrates the parable uttered by Christ

Give us this bread. His reply is, The bread is
already given; it is for you to accept and feed
upon it. And this is always the answer of the
gospel to every soul that cries out for a Saviour
and a salvation. How the soul is to accept this
bread he then goes on to say.—&#8203;<b>He that cometh

clear that the “coming” and “believing in”

continuous coming (present participle with <span lang="el">πρός</span>);
a coming into Christ’s likeness, and therefore
into spiritual unity with him; a coming perfected
only by the process of feeding upon him,
drinking in his spiritual power so as to be transformed
by it. It is the coming which David describes
in Psalm 63:8, “My soul followeth hard

hunger and thirst are not ended when Christian

<p><b>37, 38. The all which the Father has
given to me shall come toward me, and
he that comes toward me I will in no wise
cast out.</b> <em>Toward</em>, not <em>to</em> me. The original
(<span lang="el">πρὸς</span>) indicates the object toward which anything
is directed, not ordinarily the goal actually
reached. The promise then is that he who sets
out in the direction of Christ shall not be rejected
by him. He does not wait till we have come
to him; he receives us when we start toward
him. In this and the next verse <em>all</em> (<span lang="el">πᾶν</span>) is in
the neuter gender, indicating, not that the body
is included with the soul (<cite>Maurice</cite>), but that <em>the
whole</em> is given by the Father in its totality, but is
received by the Son separately and individually.
“In Jesus Christ’s discourses, that which the
Father hath given to the Son himself is termed,
in the singular number and neuter gender, <em>all</em>;
those who come to the Son himself are described
in the masculine gender, or even the plural number,
<em>every one</em>, or <em>they</em>. The Father has given to
the Son the whole mass, as it were, that all
whom he hath given may be one; that whole the
Son develops individually in the execution of the
divine plan.”—(<cite>Bengel.</cite>) Christ’s language here
indicates his dependence upon the Father’s will
and power, and is analogous to that in many of
his discourses, especially in those reported by
John. He has come to do his Father’s will; the
works which he does are those which his Father
has given him to do, and are done by his Father’s
power; the words which he speaks are his Father’s
words; his whole life is represented as the
incarnate expression of his Father’s will; and
those whom he saves are saved not by his own
independent power, they are those whom his
Father has given him (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch10_28">10:28</a>, <a href="#ch10_29">29</a></span>). Here then I

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
understand Christ neither to limit his salvation
nor to declare it to be without limit. He simply
asserts on the one hand that his saving power is
efficacious only over those whom the Father has
given unto him, and on the other that there is
nothing lacking in his grace or power which shall
cause those thus given to fail of a perfected salvation.
As a Saviour he is the representative of the
Father’s gracious love and power. Here there is
no indication who are the <em>all</em> thus given to him.
From other Scripture, however, it appears clear
that it includes many among the heathen nations
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 2:8 with <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 8:11</span>), and that it does not include
the entire human race (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_6">17:6</a>, <a href="#ch17_9">9</a>, <a href="#ch17_25">25</a></span>). This interpretation
is confirmed by the verse which follows,
which further expresses the subjection of
the Son in his mediatorial work to the Father.—&#8203;<b>Because
I came down from heaven, not
that I might do mine own will, but the
will of him that sent me.</b> The catholicity of
Christ’s love is a disclosure of the love of the
Father toward us. In these words Christ gives
us a suggestion of the reason of his receiving
sinners and making them companions and associates.
His own earthy inclinations, tastes, and
sensibilities, had he followed them, would all
have been against such society; but all were
subordinate to, and overridden by, his great controlling
purpose that the world through him
might be saved (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch3_17">3:17</a>; 1 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 1:15</span>). For every
Christian disciple there is a practical lesson in
these words of Christ. We are all sent into the
world as Christ also was sent into the world
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_18">17:18</a></span>); and it is ours to see to it that no pride,
or social taste, or moral irresolution, induce us to
cast out those who would otherwise come to us
for help; but we are also to remember that our
power to help does not extend beyond those
whom the Father in his own gracious wisdom
has seen fit to give to us as the seals to our apostleship
(<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 9:2</span>).</p>

the <em>whole</em> is given to the Son; but each one

life; and I will raise him up at the last
day.</b> These verses clearly imply (1) that there
is nothing in any secret decree or election of
God, or in the nature or extent of the provisions
of divine grace, to limit the gift of eternal life or
prevent any one from receiving it through faith
in the Son; (2) that the only condition required
is one inherent in the nature of the case, namely,
a sincere belief in, and desire for, that spiritual
life which alone is eternal and of which Christ
is the supreme manifestation; (3) that whoever
has once thus looked to Christ with living faith
has an absolute assurance of preservation from
the weakness of his own will, as well as from
external temptation, an assurance afforded by
Christ’s declaration, “Of all which he has given
me I shall lose nothing.” It does not imply a
literal bodily resurrection. The literalism which
so reads this promise is akin to that which misinterpreted
Christ’s language respecting eating
his flesh and drinking his blood. The whole
spirit and tone of this discourse is poetic and
metaphorical.</p>

<p><b>43-45. Jesus therefore answered</b>, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
<b>No one</b> (not, <em>no man</em>) <b>can come unto
me except the Father which has sent me
draw him</b>. Parallel to this declaration is that
of <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 16:17; the true knowledge of Christ is
revealed to the soul by the Father. There has
been much theological discussion as to the proper
interpretation of this passage. On the one hand,
Calvin declares that “it is therefore a false and
profane assertion, that none are <em>drawn</em> but
those who are willing to be <em>drawn</em>, as if man
made himself obedient to God by his own efforts;
for the willingness with which men follow
God is what they already have from himself,
who has framed their hearts to obey him;” on
the other hand, Adam Clark, representing the
Arminian school of theology, thus interprets the
divine drawing: “A man is attracted by that
which he delights in. Show green herbage to a
sheep, he is drawn by it; show nuts to a child,
and he is drawn by them. They run wherever
the person runs who shows these things; they
run after him, but they are not forced to follow;
they run through the desire they feel to get the
things they delight in. So God draws man; he
shows him his <span style="white-space:nowrap;">wants—he</span> shows the Saviour
whom he has provided for him.” The true interpretation
of the declaration involves the long
disputed and yet unsettled problem of the psychology
of the will, what is the nature of and
what are the limits to its freedom of action, a
problem which belongs rather to the domain of
mental science than to that of theology or Biblical
interpretation. In interpreting this passage,
however, the student should consider: (1) the literal
meaning of the word draw (<span lang="el">ἕλκω</span>). This primarily
carries with it the idea of force, and is
used by Homer of carrying one away captive; by
Luke, of dragging persons before a court (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts
16:19; <abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
James 2:6</span>); and by John himself of
dragging a net (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch21_6">21:6</a>,
<a href="#ch21_11">11</a></span>). Thus the metaphor
involved in the word implies at least a certain
resistance to the divine love and a certain difficulty
to be overcome by the divine drawing. (2)
Parallel teachings in the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>
and <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="Solomon">Sol.</abbr> Song 4:1; <abbr title="Jeremiah">Jer.</abbr> 31:3;
<abbr title="Hosea">Hos.</abbr> 11:4; Luke 14:23, note; John
<a href="#ch12_32">12:32</a>; 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 1:9</span>),
where the word <em>called</em> is parallel
to the word <em>draw</em> here (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:12, 13</span>).
(3) Christ’s
own interpretation of the Father’s drawing, afforded
by <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 45. They that have learned of the
Father are they that are drawn by him. (4) The
nature of that coming to Christ which is the object
of the divine drawing. “We do not come
to Christ by walking, but by believing; not by
the movement of the body, but by the free will
of the heart. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Think not that thou
art drawn against thy will, for the mind is drawn
by love.”—(<cite>Augustine.</cite>) Interpreting this passage
in the light of these considerations, I understand
not that God drags the unwilling by an
irresistible grace, nor merely the willing by placing
before the will in its natural condition such
objects—a sense of its needs and a revelation of
its <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Saviour—as</span> attract the unsatisfied heart to
himself; but that he makes the soul willing in
the day of his power, working in us both to will
and to do of his good pleasure
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 110:3;
<abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:13</span>).—&#8203;<b>It
is written in the prophets</b> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 54:13</span>),
<b>They shall be all taught of God</b>. The <em>all</em>
here appears clearly from the reference in Isaiah
to be all the children of God, not all humanity.—&#8203;<b>Every
one, therefore, hearing from the
Father and learning, comes unto me.</b>
Emphasis is placed by the structure of the sentence
in the original Greek on the word <em>learning</em>.
The Pharisees heard, but they did not learn. He
that does not reverently recognize the divine
glory in the life and character of Christ, who
sees no beauty in him that he should desire him,
does not possess true piety, has not heard and
learned of God.</p>

<p><b>47, 48. Verily, verily, I say unto you,
He that hath faith hath eternal life.</b> The
words <em>on me</em> are wanting in the best manuscripts,
are omitted by Tischendorf and Alford, and are
queried by Schaff; internal evidence is against
them. The declaration is generic; faith in the
largest sense of that <span style="white-space:nowrap;">word—the</span> power which lays
hold upon the invisible and the hope which
reaches after it (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 11:1</span>), a faith which may be
and is exercised by those who have never known
Christ (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 2:7</span>), is the essential condition of
spiritual life. This life is not, as in our English
version, merely “everlasting life,” but life eternal,
<i>i. e.</i>, the spiritual life which is created in the
soul when it is born from above, which is nurtured
in the soul that follows after that it may
apprehend Christ Jesus (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 3:12</span>), the fruits of
which are love, joy, peace, etc. (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 5:22, 23</span>). This
eternal life is a present possession; he that hath
faith already hath this life.—&#8203;<b>I am the bread
of that life.</b> Faith may exist without Christ,
as it did in the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> prophets and patriarchs,
and as it does in greater or less measure in some
at least of those in heathen lands; but Christ is
the bread of that life; by him it is fed, strengthened,
and made to grow; by him faith in invisible
things is made rich and strong. The universal
effect of a pure Christianity has been to turn
the mind away from material things to unseen
realities (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 3:18</span>).</p>

<p><b>49-51.</b> In these verses Christ marks the contrast
between the bread given in the wilderness
through Moses, to which the people had referred
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch6_31">31</a></span>), and for a repetition of which they had
asked, and the spiritual bread of which this
material manna was but a type. That manna
was temporary in its effects, the fathers were
dead, of this spiritual bread if one eats he shall
<em>not</em> die, it is eternal in its effects; that bread was
material, dead, this is a living and immortal
bread; that was given to a few, the Jewish nation,
this descends from heaven, that any one
may eat of it, it is for universal humanity; that
bread was bestowed without suffering, this
bread is a divine sacrifice given for the sake of
saving others from suffering.—&#8203;<b>This</b> (fellow) <b>is
the bread</b>. They had said (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch6_42">42</a></span>), “How then
saith this fellow?” He replies, repeating their
language of contempt, This (fellow, <span lang="el">οὗτός</span>) is the
bread which descends from heaven. Observe
that his language here, as throughout this discourse,
implies his pre-existence, if not his supernatural
birth.—&#8203;<b>In order that any one
may eat of it and may not die.</b> Not merely
“that one may eat;” his language, “that any
one may eat,” implies the universality of divine
grace; the bread is for whosoever will.—&#8203;<b>I am
the living bread.</b> Not equivalent to life-giving,
for which another Greek word (not <span lang="el">ζόω</span>, but
<span lang="el">ζοωποιέω</span>) would have been used. Here, as in
John <a href="#ch4_10">4:10</a>, is signified the spiritual life of the
food itself which Christ affords by the bestowal
of himself. It is true that Christ is life-giving,
but he is so because he is ever-living. He <em>is</em> the
life, therefore he <em>gives</em> life.—&#8203;<b>If any one eat of
this bread.</b> Again the universality of divine
grace is implied. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> Acts 2:38, 39, note and
refs. there.—&#8203;<b>He shall live unto eternity.</b>
Not merely <em>forever</em>. The idea here, as everywhere
throughout the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>, is not merely an
endless existence, which might be no boon, but
an immortal, a divine life, the very life of God,
making the new-born soul a true son of God.—&#8203;<b>And
the bread which I will give.</b> Observe
the future tense. He speaks therefore of a gift
yet to be perfected by his passion and death.—&#8203;<b>Is
my flesh, which I will give for the sake
of</b> (<span lang="el">ὑπὲρ</span>) <b>the life of the world</b>. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch3_16">3:16</a>. It seems to me that these enigmatical
words are added to guard the church from falling
into the error of supposing that Christ’s <em>doctrine</em>
is the bread of life, and that to hear and
believe his words as a divine teacher is to secure
the life eternal of which he speaks. This bread is
not merely the teaching nor the example of Christ;
the sacrifice is an essential principle of that spiritual
food which he has provided for the world’s life.</p>

<p><b>52. How can this</b> (fellow) <b>give us his

Christ’s words with precisely the literalism with
which the church of Rome has interpreted them
since. The rest of the discourse Christ devotes
to guarding his hearers against this misapprehension
of literal and prosaic natures, and to
emphasizing the mystical doctrine to the elucidation
of which the whole discourse is devoted.
Verses <a href="#ch6_53">53-55</a> reiterate and re-emphasize the
truth that the soul must feed on Christ, receive

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
him, his life, his death, his character, as the
supply of its own spiritual life; verses <a href="#ch6_57">57-59</a> and
verses <a href="#ch6_61">61-63</a> interpret what he means by the
metaphor. In the interpretation of Christ’s
symbolic language here we are to guard ourselves
against simplifying it, either by a literal
rendering on the one hand, or, on the other, by
that process of rationalism which, under pretence
of interpreting a metaphor, does away with
it altogether. If there were nothing mystical in
the doctrine, we may be sure that Christ would
not have clothed it in language seemingly so full
of mysticism.</p>

<p><b>53-55. Therefore Jesus said unto them.</b>
Therefore connects what follows with what has
preceded; he emphasizes and explains the eating
and drinking, in response to their interruption in
<abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 53.—&#8203;<b>Verily, verily, I say unto you.</b>
These words give a solemn emphasis to the declaration
which follows.—&#8203;<b>Except ye eat the
flesh of the Son of man.</b> That is, of the Messiah
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 10:23, note</span>).—&#8203;<b>And drink his blood.</b>
The use of animal blood in any form was prohibited
to the Israelites as food (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 9:4;
 <abbr title="Leviticus">Lev.</abbr> 3:17;
7:26, 27; 17:10-14; 19:26; <abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> 12:16, 23; 15:23</span>), and was
exceedingly odious to the Jewish thought.
Moreover, to touch even the corpse of a man
rendered the Jew unclean. It is not, therefore,
strange that Christ’s language here should have
offended many even of his disciples
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch6_60">60</a></span>).—&#8203;<b>Ye
have no life in you.</b> The mere physical life
is accounted in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> no life at all. The true
life is that of God in the soul, the absence of
which is death.—&#8203;<b>Whoso eateth my flesh.</b>
The Greek verb rendered in both places <em>eat</em> is
different from that used above. The word here
(<span lang="el">τρώγω</span>) signifies literally to <em>chew</em> or <em>masticate</em>, and
seems to me to have been substituted by Christ
for the more general one (<span lang="el">φαγεῖν</span>), in order to
add still further emphasis to the doctrine which
he is expounding.—&#8203;<b>And drinketh my blood,
hath eternal life.</b> A present possession. See
<abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch6_47">47</a>,
note.—&#8203;<b>And I will raise him up at
the last day.</b> This is one of the passages on
which the advocates of the doctrine of conditional
immortality base their belief. The promise
of resurrection here certainly is limited to those
who through faith have received the gift of eternal
life.—&#8203;<b>For my flesh is true meat and
my blood is true drink.</b> To Christ the material
universe was but a shadow, and the realities
were those things of which the material
universe is a type. “Food and drink are not
here mere metaphors; rather are our common
material food and drink mere shadows and imperfect
types of this only real reception of refreshment
and nourishment into the being.”—(<cite>Alford.</cite>)
In the interpretation of Christ’s language
here, the student must remember the
declaration respecting him, “Without a parable
spake he not unto them” (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 4:34</span>); unquestionably
the language here is parabolic. It is
also true that the phrases eating and drinking
were used among the Jews in a metaphorical
sense, and that bread especially was employed
among them as a symbol for doctrine (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 3:1; <abbr title="Jeremiah">Jer.</abbr>
15:16; Lightfoot on John 6:51; Geikie’s Life of Christ, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 44,
note c</span>). It seems to me, however, very clear not
only that Christ here means something more than
receiving his doctrines, but that he employs his
peculiar language for the express purpose of
emphasizing the truth that it is not merely
enough to receive him as a teacher. If this had
been his meaning, it would have been easy to correct
the misapprehension of his Jewish hearers,
and remove the offence which they felt at his discourse.
This he does not do. On the contrary,
he declares, not that they must eat the <em>bread</em> of
the Son of man, but that they must eat <em>his flesh</em>
and drink <em>his blood</em> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch6_53">53</a></span>); in a slightly different
form, he reiterates this declaration in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch6_54">54</a>;
and finally, to avoid the possibility of the misinterpretation
which substitutes his teaching for
his personal presence and influence, he adds the
emphatic declaration of <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch6_55">55</a>. If something
more than accepting and following the teaching
of Christ is not meant by these verses, then it
would seem that Christ has embodied a very
simple truth in very unnecessarily mystical language.
That more than this is meant I take to
be declared unmistakably by verses <a href="#ch6_53">53-55</a>; what
more than this is meant it is the object of verses
<a href="#ch6_56">56-58</a> to show. The commentators have discussed
at great length the question what relation the
solemn assertions of these verses bear to the
Lord’s Supper. There are three general opinions:
(1) that no reference to the Lord’s Supper
is intended; (2) that the whole passage exclusively
relates to the Lord’s Supper prophetically;
(3) that the idea involved in the Lord’s Supper,
but not the ordinance itself, is referred to. For
discussion of these opinions, see Alford’s note.
To me it seems clear that Christ here teaches by
a word-parable the same truth which he subsequently
embodies in a parable in action in the
ordinance of the Supper; whether he prophetically
refers to it or not is a question of no great
importance.</p>

Father hath sent me and I live by the
Father, so he that eateth me, even he
shall live by me.</b> This one verse should have
prevented the three current errors of interpretation
in this chapter: (1) that spiritual life is dependent
on a literal feeding on Christ’s body and
blood; (2) that it is dependent on a sacramental
feeding on the sacred symbols of his body; (3)
that it requires only a belief in him as a religious
teacher. How did Christ live by the Father?
Certainly not by any literal eating of the Father’s
flesh or drinking of the Father’s blood; nor by
any symbol or ceremonial whatever; nor yet by
any mere hearing and obeying of the Father’s
words. The Father was personally present in
Christ; Christ, by his words and his acts, manifested
the indwelling glory of the Father; so
Christ fed on the Father because the Father was
the source and supply of his spiritual life. In
like manner we feed on Christ, not when we
merely accept and endeavor to follow his precepts,
but when, under the direct personal influence
of his spiritual presence, we manifest his
glory unto the world, having not merely a spirit
like Christ, but having the very spirit of Christ
himself in us (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr>
8:9, 10</span>).—&#8203;<b>This is that bread
which came down from heaven.</b> Christ
thus interprets his own previous metaphor.—&#8203;<b>Not
as your fathers did eat and are dead.</b>
Again he guards the Jews against their literal
interpretation; the eating of which he has spoken
is not the physical eating for the supply of
the body; this can never give true life.</p>

<p>After this chapter had gone to press a remarkable
article from the pen of Dean Stanley appeared
on “The Eucharist” in the Nineteenth
Century (May, 1878), in which he arrives at
substantially the same conclusions that I have
arrived at in these notes, and enforces them with
his usual eloquence and learning. He urges that
in all religious ordinances we ought to try to get
beneath the phrases we use, and not to rest satisfied
with the words, however excellent, till we
have ascertained their meaning; that Christ’s
words here and in the appointment of the last
supper as a permanent memorial ordinance are
evidently metaphorical; that the very strangeness
of the metaphor should turn our thoughts
from the outward form to the inward essence;
that the body and flesh signify the personality
and character of Christ; that we must incorporate
in ourselves, that is in our moral natures,
the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">substance—the</span> moral <span style="white-space:nowrap;">substance—of</span> the
teaching and character of Jesus Christ; that this
is the only true transubstantiation; that the blood
of Christ is his spirit, the inmost essence of his
character, the self of his self; and that to drink
his blood is to imbibe this inmost spirit; that
this spirit is love or charity, which is throughout
the New Testament represented as the fundamental
essence of the highest life of God, and
therefore of his children; and he interprets
verses <a href="#ch6_53">53-56</a> here, in accordance with these principles,
as follows: “This is one of those startling
expressions used by Christ to show us that he
intends to drive us from the letter to the spirit,
by which he shatters the crust and shell in order
to force us to the kernel. It is as if he said: ‘It
is not enough for you to see the outward face of
the Son of man, or hear his outward words, or
touch his outward vesture. That is not himself.
It is not enough that you walk by his side, or
hear others talk of him or use terms of affection
and endearment toward him. You must go
deeper than this; you must go to his very inmost
heart, to the very core and marrow of his
being. You must not only read and understand,
but you must mark, learn, and inwardly digest,
and make part of yourselves, that which alone
can be part of the human spirit and conscience.’
It expresses, with regard to the life and death of
Jesus Christ, the same general truth as is expressed
when <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul says, ‘Put ye on the Lord
Jesus <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Christ’—that</span> is, clothe yourselves with his
spirit as with a garment; or again, ‘Let the
same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus.’
It is the same general truth as when our Lord
himself says, ‘I am the vine; ye are the
branches.’”</p>

Either miraculously or by a subtle sense which
the delicately organized often possess.—&#8203;<b>Doth
this offend you?</b> <em>Stumble you.</em> See <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:29,
note; 11:6, note. The teaching of the disciple,
as the teaching of Christ, will sometimes
be to men a stumbling-stone and a rock of offence.—&#8203;<b>What
and if ye shall see the Son
of man ascend up where he was before?</b>
Another admonition that they are not to take
his words in a material sense, for in his glorified
body he is to ascend into heaven before their
sight. The language is a strong testimony to
the historical verity of the ascension.—&#8203;<b>The
spirit is the life-giver, the flesh profiteth
nothing whatsoever</b>; <i>i. e.</i>, It is my spirit in
your spirit which will give eternal life, not my
flesh in your flesh. This is the natural meaning
of these words, and they are to be taken in their
material sense, not with such qualifications as that
of Augustine, “The flesh alone and by itself
profiteth not,” <i>i. e.</i>, without the blessing of the
spirit; or such as that of Alford, “He does not
say <em>my</em> flesh profiteth nothing, but <em>the</em> flesh.”
<em>The</em> flesh is <em>my</em> flesh; for it is only of his own
flesh that he has spoken at all in this discourse.
The flesh of Christ, if it could be miraculously
reproduced by the benediction of a priest, would
still be of no profit.—&#8203;<b>The words which I have
spoken to you, they are spirit and they
are life.</b> The meaning is not that Christ’s
words are themselves life-giving, though this is
true; but that the words which he has just spoken
to them respecting his flesh and his blood
relate to the spiritual realm and the eternal life,
and are to be so interpreted.</p>

<p><b>64, 65. But there are some among you
who have not faith.</b> Such could not receive
the teaching of Christ, for it is true in spiritual
as in physical gifts, according to one’s faith, so
is Christ’s blessing (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 9:29</span>).—&#8203;<b>For Jesus
knew from the beginning</b>, etc. Compare
this distinct statement of Christ’s foreknowledge
with Christ’s own statement of the limitations
of his knowledge in Mark 13:32. The contrast
illustrates one of the inexplicable mysteries of
Christ’s nature, whose knowledge transcended
that of man, yet in his earthly condition was less
than that of omniscience. To the question, Why,
if he foreknew the betrayal of Judas, did he ordain
him as an apostle? there is no satisfactory
answer. The problem of divine foreknowledge
and human free-will, of that divine law the inflexibility
of which science has in these later days
so strikingly demonstrated, and that freedom of
moral action to which universal consciousness testifies,
is one which transcends the limits of the
human intellect.—&#8203;<b>Therefore said I unto you
that no one can come unto me except it
were given unto him of my Father.</b> Judas
and the withdrawing disciples had, in a sense,
come unto him; they had followed him, accepted
him as their Master, and had given him
for a time their allegiance. Yet they had not
really come to him, for no one truly comes except
he is drawn by a divine influence. <em>Therefore</em>
connects the declaration of <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 44 with the fact
here stated that some of the disciples were without
true faith. The practical warning to us here
is this, that we have need to examine ourselves
that we may know whether our coming to Christ
has been merely that of a natural inclination or
that of obedience to the impulse of the Spirit of
God.</p>

<p><b>66, 67. From this many of his disciples
went back.</b> <em>From this</em> indicates both, as the
English version represents, the <em>time</em> from which
this withdrawal dated, and also the <em>cause</em> from
which it proceeded. Observe that faithful
preaching will drive some apparent disciples
away from Christ. The minister, like his Master,
will ever have the fan in his hand, and the
gospel which he preaches will in some measure
separate the chaff from the grain. This was illustrated
in the experience of the apostle Paul.
See Acts 13:44-46; 14:4; 17:12, 13, etc. “It
will never be possible for us to exercise such

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
caution that the doctrine of Christ shall not be
the occasion of offence to many; because the
reprobate, who are devoted to destruction, suck
venom from the most wholesome food and gall
from honey. The Son of God undoubtedly knew
what was useful, and yet we see that he cannot
avoid offending many of his disciples.”—(<cite>Calvin.</cite>)—&#8203;<b>Then
said Jesus also to the twelve, Ye
do not also wish to go away?</b> The tone is
one of pathetic protest; the language that of one
who felt keenly the desertion, and yearned for
an expression of the fidelity of his immediate
friends, not as an assurance, for he knew from
the beginning who believed not, and therefore
who believed and would endure, but as an utterance
of loyalty and love. At the same time he
leads them to a confession which draws them
more closely and binds them more tenderly to
himself.</p>

hast the words of eternal life.</b> As
Martha’s utterance of her faith in John <a href="#ch11_27">11:27</a>,
so Peter’s declaration here is not wholly responsive
to the discourse that has preceded. He
does not fully comprehend the meaning of that
personal feeding on Christ of which the Lord has
been speaking; but he believes that Christ’s
words, though he does not fully understand
them, are words of, that is full of, eternal life,
and that he is the Messiah and the Son of God.
And in this faith he is content to await humbly
till the full meaning of Christ’s enigmatical discourse
shall be revealed to him, as it could not
be till Christ’s death, resurrection, and ascension,
and the descent of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p><a id="Note_ch7"></a><span class="smcap">Preliminary Note.</span>—Between the close of <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
6 and the beginning of <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 7 occurred a period of
retirement, employed by Christ in giving to his
apostles especial instructions concerning the
kingdom of God. The fullest account of these
instructions is afforded in Matthew, <abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr> 15,
16, 17, 18. During this time occurred the healing
of the Syrophenician woman’s daughter and
the transfiguration. The public ministry of
Christ in Galilee was substantially brought to an
end by his sermon in the synagogue at Capernaum
and his consequent rejection by the people.
The ministry in Judea begins with this
chapter and continues to <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch10_39">39</a> of the tenth
chapter, verses <a href="#ch7_40">40-42</a> affording a concise statement
of that ministry in Perea, of which Luke
alone gives any extended account. The journey
to Jerusalem mentioned below
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch7_10">10</a></span>) is, I think
erroneously, identified by some harmonists with
that described by Luke, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 9:51, 52. That
journey was immediately before his passion, and
was notably public, messengers going before his
face to prepare the way for him; this was “as it
were in secret,” and six months of instruction in
Judea and Perea intervened between it and his
death. See Luke 9:51-56, <abbr title="Preliminary">Prel.</abbr> Note, and Tabular

<p><b>2-4. Now the Jews’ feast of Tabernacles
was at hand.</b> This was one of the three
greater festivals to be observed by Israel. It
was also called the feast of Ingathering, from
the fact that it was held at the year’s end, when

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
all the labors of the field were consummated. It
thus resembled nearly our own Thanksgiving
Day. It commenced on the fifteenth of the seventh
month, answering to our October, and lasted
seven days. It was instituted to commemorate
the dwelling in tents when in the desert; accordingly,
while the feast lasted the people dwelt in
booths or tents placed on the flat roofs of the
houses, in the courts of the temple, and in the
squares and open places, and the streets when
their width allowed. The particular sacrifices
to be offered are detailed in <abbr title="Numbers">Num.</abbr> 29:1-38, and
notices of the observance are to be found in <abbr title="Nehemiah">Neh.</abbr>
8:13-18; <abbr title="Hosea">Hos.</abbr> 12:9; <abbr title="Zechariah">Zech.</abbr> 14:16-19.—&#8203;<b>His
brethren.</b> Their names are given in <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 13:55.
I believe his half brothers, children of Joseph
and Mary, are intended. See Note on
Brethren of the Lord, <abbr title="Volume One">Vol. I</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 187.—&#8203;<b>That thy
disciples also may see the works that
thou doest.</b> This was after the commission,
the missionary tour, and the return of the twelve
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 10</span>), through whose ministry probably
many had become in a certain loose sense disciples
of our Lord, regarding him as a Jewish
rabbi, and perhaps as an inspired prophet, who
had never seen him personally. The language
of Christ’s brothers is that of contempt. Leave
this province, said they, and go up into Judea,
the religious centre of the Holy Land, and show
yourself to those who have heard of you, and
exhibit to them what you can do. Additional
significance is given to this language if we remember
that it was used after a period of retirement
of more than six months. <a href="#Note_ch7">See above</a>.—&#8203;<b>For
no one does anything in secret, and
yet seeks himself to be frank and open</b>
(<span lang="el">ἐν παῤῥησίᾳ</span>). The intimation is that the reason
why Jesus does not make more public exhibition
of himself and his work is that he is deceiving
the people. His brothers attempt to compel him
to adopt their policy by imputing to him, because
of his course, a lack of frankness and fearlessness.—&#8203;<b>If
thou do these things, show
thyself to the world.</b> <em>If</em> implies a doubt. In
a worldly view the policy of these brothers
would seem wise; but it was really, in a more
subtle form, the policy suggested by Satan in the
second temptation (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 4:5-7</span>). Christ would be
accepted by faith and love, not by wonder and
fear; for the sake of his truth, not because of
his miracles. These he persistently refused to
show to the world as a means of compelling allegiance.</p>

<p><b>5. For neither had his brethren faith in

that none of the brethren here mentioned were

Simon, and Judas, the brethren of the Lord,
cannot be the apostles who bore the same name.
They afterward became believers (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 1:14; 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr>
9:5</span>). They may at this time have recognized
that Jesus possessed extraordinary powers, without
recognizing in him the Messiah, or even an
inspired teacher, whose instructions they were
willing to follow. “They expected him to make
a startling exhibition of his power to the eye.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
in which was disclosed that love which
is the wisdom and power of God unto salvation
(<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 1:24</span>), and in which, even at the time and by
the manner of his death, his divine Sonship was
revealed to the Roman centurion (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 15:39</span>); yet
again by his resurrection from the dead (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 2:32-36;
3:15</span>); increasingly in the ages since, by his
personal presence and power in the church (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
28:18, 20; <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 1:3, 4</span>); a manifestation to be finally
consummated when he is revealed from heaven

preparing the world, casting up a highway for
him; and not till this highway is completed and
he comes again shall all flesh see the salvation of
God (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 3:4-6</span>). The time of his brothers was
always prepared; for the world is always ready
for him who has no message for it. “If I,” said
Luther, “would speak what the Papists like to
hear, I would be very glad, too, to take lodgings
with the Bishop of Magdeburg at Rome.” “The
Son of man feels all the difference between those
whose time was always ready, who could go up
to the feasts whenever it pleased them, merely
with the expectation of meeting friends and
mixing in a crowd, and him who had the straitening
consciousness of a message which he must
bear, of a baptism which he must be baptized
with.”—(<cite>Maurice.</cite>)—&#8203;<b>The world cannot hate

3:13; Luke 6:26. He that would preach the
gospel of salvation to the world must first testify
of it that its deeds are evil. The Holy Spirit
convinces the world of righteousness only after
convincing it of sin (<span class="muchsmaller">John
<a href="#ch16_8">16:8</a>, <a href="#ch16_9">9</a></span>). For illustrations
of Christ’s preaching against the works of the
world, see <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:20; 6:1, 2, 5, 16; 7:22;
11:16-24; 12:39-15; Luke 6:46; 10:12-16;
11:45-54; 12:54-57, etc. A study of the
preaching of Christ and the apostles, and of the
writings of Paul, will show that the divine
method is always to convince of sin as a preparation
for proclaiming the good news of salvation
from it.—&#8203;<b>I go not unto this feast.</b> The word
yet is not in the original, though it probably correctly
interprets the real meaning of Christ’s
answer. This was not, <b>I shall not go</b> (future),
but, <b>I am not now going</b> (present). Perhaps
Christ did not know whether he should go or
not; he who acted constantly under the guidance
of the Divine Spirit may not have received guidance
on this point. It would at all events have
defeated his purpose to have gone up with those
who were determined that he should make an
exhibition of himself and his work. There is no
ground for either the reproach that he deceived
his brethren, or that he acted in a fickle manner
in subsequently going up to the feast.</p>

man, that they cannot name him.”—(<cite>Luther.</cite>)—&#8203;<b>And
there was much murmuring.</b> The
original (<span lang="el">γογγυσμός</span>) implies suppressed discourse.—&#8203;<b>Some
indeed said.</b> The Greek particle
which I have rendered <em>indeed</em> (<span lang="el">μέν</span>) implies a concession,
at the same time pointing forward to
something antithetic. The implication is that
among the Judeans the believers were a minority.—&#8203;<b>No!
but he deceiveth the people.</b> He
that is popular with the multitude is generally
looked upon with aversion by the hierarchy.—&#8203;<b>No
one spoke openly.</b> “Both mistrusted the
hierarchy; even those hostile in their judgment
were afraid, so long as they had not given their
official decision, that their verdict might be reversed.
A true indication of an utterly Jesuitical
domination of the people.”—(<cite>Meyer.</cite>) Hostility
to Christianity fears nothing so much as
free discussion; and it quite accords with human
nature that the consideration of Christ’s claims
by the people at all should be dreaded by the
priesthood. The interpretation of Alford, Godet,
Tholuck, and others, that only the friends
of Christ feared to speak openly, is in direct conflict
with the explicit language of the narrative.

Maurice pictures the scene well: “It is a hum
of voices. There is a fear of something, the people
do not well know of what. It is a fear of the
Jews; the apostle says each fears the other.
There is a concentrated Jewish feeling in the
Sanhedrim, among the rulers, which all tremble
at. Till that has been <span style="white-space:nowrap;">pronounced—above</span> all,
while there is a suspicion that it will come forth
in <span style="white-space:nowrap;">condemnation—it</span> is not wise for any to commit

<p><b>14, 15. About the midst of the feast.</b>
Bengel calculates that on this year the middle of
the feast would be the Sabbath; the temple would
in that case be especially crowded, and the day
would suggest the remarks respecting the Sabbath.—&#8203;<b>Jesus
went up into the temple and
taught.</b> He came to Judea privately, he went
into the temple publicly; he would not exhibit
himself, he would not conceal his doctrine.—&#8203;<b>And
the Judeans marvelled, saying.</b> The
form of the question which follows indicates a
hostile spirit; but it may have been raised, not
by the scribes or teachers (<cite>Meyer</cite>, <cite>Alford</cite>), but
by the people (<cite>Tholuck</cite>).—&#8203;<b>How knoweth this
fellow learning, never having been
taught?</b> “A rule analogous to that which still
prevails in most church communions forbade
any rabbi to teach new truths except he was a
regular graduate of one of the theological
schools. He might catechise, but he could not
preach. This rule the Jews cited against Jesus.
‘How,’ said they contemptuously, ‘does this
man know anything of sacred literature, being
no graduate?’”—(<cite>Abbott’s Jesus of Nazareth.</cite>)
<em>Letters</em> (<span lang="el">γράμμα</span>) is here the sacred writings of
the Jews, <i>i. e.</i>, the sacred Scriptures and the
comments thereon. This question affords the
key to the interpretation of the discourse which
follows, which is upon the authority, primarily
of Christ, secondarily of every Christian teacher,
an authority derived, not from theological schools
or clerical ordination, but from the indwelling
Spirit of God. Christ was himself a “lay preacher;”
his example and his precept alike sanction
unordained preaching.</p>

<p><b>16, 17. My teaching is not mine, but his
that sent me.</b> For <em>doctrine</em> read <em>teaching</em>; for
not merely the subject-matter taught, but the
power with which it was presented, was divine.
<em>My teaching is not mine</em> is not a hyperbole. It is
not merely equivalent to “not acquired by any
labor on my part in learning” (<cite>Bengel</cite>), or “not
an invention of my own” (<cite>Geikie</cite>). Neither in
origin nor in aim was Christ’s teaching his own.
Ever about his Father’s business, he was ever
teaching his Father’s words and doing his Father’s
works (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch5_19">5:19</a>, <a href="#ch5_30">30</a></span>). In a sense every true
Christian teacher should be able to repeat this
saying of Christ (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr> <a href="#ch14_16">14:26</a>; <a href="#ch16_13">16:13</a></span>). It does not
follow that the Christian teacher need not be a
Christian student; but it does follow that he
should be a student only of those things which
enable him better to understand and interpret
the Father’s will and nature. Only so far as
schools of theological thought help him to do
this are they truly Christian schools.—&#8203;<b>If any
one wills to do his will, he shall know
concerning the teaching, whether it be
of God or whether I speak of myself.</b> An
often misunderstood declaration. The promise
is not that if any man does God’s will all theology
shall be made clear to him, nor even that he
shall be brought to a correct apprehension of the
most important truths of the Christian system.
The last clause qualifies the first; the declaration
is that if any man purposes to do God’s will,
<em>makes that his ultimate and supreme choice</em> (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr>
6:11-16</span>), he shall know respecting Christianity
<em>whether it is of divine or human origin</em>. The declaration
is both a promise and the enunciation of
a spiritual law. The purpose to do God’s will
itself clarifies the spiritual sight, so that the soul
recognizes the Spirit of God in the life, the character,
and the teachings of his Son. The degree
of advancement which one subsequently makes
in comprehending the full significance of those
teachings will depend partly upon the purity of
his spiritual purposes, but partly upon other
conditions. Not the mere outward obedience to
God’s commandments, but a true spiritual purpose,
is declared to be the condition of spiritual
light; and to that purpose is attached, not a
promise of <em>all</em> light, but only of so much as will
enable the soul to know the source from which
it may obtain constantly increasing illumination.
Nevertheless, the first step toward the solution
of any theological difficulty whatever, is repentance
of sin and practical obedience to the voice
of God in the soul. Except a man be born again
he cannot <em>see</em> the kingdom of God.</p>

the more immediate cause. The former refers

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
to what is general, the latter to what is special.
See <cite><abbr title="Robinson's Lexicon">Rob. Lex.</abbr></cite>, <span lang="el">ἀπό</span>. Every Christian teacher
must speak <em>out of</em> himself, <i>i. e.</i>, out of his own
experience of truth internally possessed and become
a part of his nature; but no Christian
teacher may speak, <em>from</em> himself, <i>i. e.</i>, of his own
notions and by his own authority. The inward
experience out of which he speaks is powerful
only as it is derived from the Spirit of God.
Egotism is the natural expression of him who
speaks from himself, and has not the rhetorical
skill to conceal the inherent weakness.—&#8203;<b>But he
that seeketh his glory that sent him, the
same is true, and no unrighteousness is in

both from error and from unrighteousness (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr>

because he is the only one in whom
there is no self-seeking.—&#8203;<b>Did not Moses give
you the law</b>, etc. The connection is well given
by Alford: “There is a close connection with
the foregoing. The will to do his will was to be
the great key to a true appreciation of his teaching;
but of this there was no example among
<em>them</em>; and therefore it was that they were no
fair judges of the teaching, but bitter opponents
and persecutors of Jesus, of whom, had they
been anxious to fulfil the law, they would have

<p><b>20-24. Thou hast a devil; who goeth
about to kill thee?</b> It is evident from
<abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch7_25">25</a>
that some of his auditors knew the secret design
which had been formed for Christ’s assassination.
Their language here is that of foulest
abuse. I judge then that they were startled by
Christ’s sudden revealing of the secret designs
against him; and with that inconsistency which
is common to the self-condemned, they in the
same sentence denied that his death had been
compassed, and implied that the fact that it was
compassed had been disclosed to him by an evil
spirit which possessed him.—&#8203;<b>Jesus answered
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I have done one work, and ye
all marvel.</b> The work referred to is that described
in the fifth chapter of John, the only
miracle in Jerusalem up to this time which is
described in detail; not the only one which he
had wrought (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr>
<a href="#ch2_23">2:23</a>; <a href="#ch3_2">3:2</a></span>), but presumptively
the last one. They wondered not at the miracle,
but at the fact that he had performed it on the
Sabbath day (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch5_16">5:16</a></span>). It is not necessary to give
to the word <em>wonder</em> here any accessory idea, as
of doubt (<cite>Bengel</cite>) or disquietude (<cite>Chrysostom</cite>);
Christ begins with the mildest characterization
of their sentiment as that of mere surprise.
Here, as habitually, he does not proceed to severe
language till milder language has proved
unavailing.—&#8203;<b>Moses therefore gave unto you
circumcision.</b> There is some doubt whether
the word <em>therefore</em> belongs to this or to the preceding
verse; <i>i. e.</i>, whether Christ says, <cite>I have
done one work, and ye all therefore marvel</cite>, or, <cite>Moses
therefore gave unto you circumcision, not because it
is of Moses, but of the fathers</cite>. The latter reading
is preferred by the later scholars, <i>e. g.</i>, Bengel,
Meyer, Alford, against Olshausen, Tholuck.
Either is grammatically possible; and the purely
grammatical considerations appear to me to
be about equally balanced. The latter interpretation
is preferable, because it gives a better
meaning to the sentence. Accepting this rendering,
the meaning appears to be, Moses gave
unto you circumcision for this reason, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, because
it was patriarchal, not because it originated
with him. And this statement of the reason of
the Mosaic law respecting circumcision affords a
basis for the argument which follows. It was a
saying of the rabbis “that circumcision drives
away the Sabbath,” and they held that the rite,
notwithstanding the work which it necessarily
entailed, might be performed on the Sabbath
day, because it was of patriarchal origin, and so
antedated the Mosaic institution of the Sabbath.
Christ, referring to this fact, convicts the Jews
of inconsistency in being angry with him for
placing the law of mercy above the law of the
Sabbath. For the law of mercy was older than
either; it belongs to the eternal law of God’s
nature.—&#8203;<b>That the law of Moses should not
be broken.</b> That law prescribed that circumcision
should be performed on the eighth day
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Leviticus">Lev.</abbr> 12:3</span>); to allow that day to pass by, therefore,
without circumcision would be a breach of
the law.—&#8203;<b>Because I have made an entire

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
man</b> (<span lang="el">ὅλον ἄνθρωπον</span>) <b>well on the Sabbath
day</b>. We can hardly suppose, with Bengel and
Olshausen, that the <em>entire man</em> here signifies the
healing of both soul and body; for there is no
evidence in the original account that the physical
was accompanied with a spiritual healing, and
no likelihood that Christ’s auditors would have
understood him here to refer to spiritual healing.
The contrast rather seems to be between circumcision
as an act of wounding, which brought
only ceremonial cleanness, and the miracle at the
pool of Bethesda, which gave relief from the
consequences of sin (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch5_14">5:14</a></span>), and gave health to
the whole body.—&#8203;<b>Judge not according to
appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</b>
See <abbr title="Zechariah">Zech.</abbr> 7:9. One of Christ’s Sabbath
laws; we are ourselves to avoid, but we are not to
condemn in others, the appearance of evil. What
is Sabbath observance and what Sabbath transgression
is to be determined, not by the external
act, but by the inward motive and the ultimate
end.</p>

of indignation with which we occasionally
meet in the teachings of Christ. The obduracy

then his language to be neither ironical
nor interrogative, but affirmative, and not to
refer to his human nature and origin, but to his
divine character and mission. In his miracles
and his instructions they had seen and heard
enough to assure them that he was from God

<cite>We know this fellow</cite>, he transformed into
an indictment against them. They had whispered
it; he proclaimed it aloud. “Ye do know
me,” he says, “and ye know whence I am, for
the authentication of my divine mission is ample.
Ye do know that I am not come of myself, for
my whole life is a conclusive demonstration that
I am not a self-seeker.” The <em>True One</em> is not
equivalent to the Truthful One nor the Really
Existent One merely, but the One True God

because the knowledge of God is only for the
pure in heart (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:8</span>). Jesus knew him, for he
had been his companion from eternity. In a
sense we are all from God, but not in the sense
in which Christ here indicates that he is from
God. The preposition used (<span lang="el">παρά</span>) has the sense
of <dfn>from beside, from near</dfn>, French <dfn>de chez</dfn> (<abbr title="Robinson's Lexicon"><cite>Rob. Lex.</cite></abbr>).
The declaration is interpreted by <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch1_1">1:1</a>;

contempt, the equally public exposure of
the secret thought of their own hearts, which
they had not themselves read as clearly as Christ
read it for them, and the tone of fearless assumption
in which he at once claimed to be the
companion of the Only True God and declared
that they did not even know Him, whose peculiar
people it was their peculiar boast to be, angered
the Judeans, and especially the hierarchy, and
led to the unsuccessful attempt to arrest Jesus
recorded in the succeeding verse.</p>

<p><b>32-34. The Pharisees and the chief
priests sent officers to take him.</b> This was
an official act on the part of the Sanhedrim or
its officers, carrying out the design of certain of
the people, as indicated in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch7_30">30</a>; and it is the
first official endeavor to arrest him, the beginning
of a course of action consummated in his
final arrest, trial, and crucifixion.—&#8203;<b>Therefore
said Jesus unto them.</b> A break evidently
occurs between verses 31 and 32. The discourse
up to <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 31 is continuous, and took place
about the middle of the feast, that is, the third
or fourth day; the discourse in verses 37-39 was
on the last day of the feast; between the two
the orders for Christ’s arrest were given. Verses
33, 34 are founded on Christ’s knowledge of
those orders, and it is a reasonable surmise that
the presence of the officers suggested it to him
and interpreted its meaning to some at least of
his auditors.—&#8203;<b>Yet a little while am I with
you.</b> About six months after this address he
was crucified.—&#8203;<b>And I go unto him that sent
me.</b> With this explicit statement of his meaning,
interpreted as it was by the previous declaration
that it was the true God who had sent
him, it is difficult to understand how the Jews
could have been perplexed respecting his meaning.
De Wette’s explanation that they knew not
the One who had sent him, and therefore that
this saying was a dark one to them, is not wholly
satisfactory, for surely they did know who was
meant by the phrase, <dfn>he that sent me</dfn>, and as surely
they could not fail to understand that going
to God was equivalent to death. Meyer supposes
that the words <cite>him that sent me</cite> in this
verse were not a part of Christ’s discourse, but
added, perhaps by John himself; but they are
not wanting in any of the manuscripts; and that
is both a doubtful and a dangerous kind of criticism
which removes a difficulty by the summary
process of removing the difficult words, without
any external authority for so doing. I believe
therefore that Christ was explicit, that he was
understood, and that the assumed perplexity of
his hearers was a piece of hypocrisy. See on
verses <a href="#ch7_35">35</a>,
<a href="#ch7_36">36</a>.—&#8203;<b>Ye shall seek and shall not
find me; and where I am ye cannot come.</b>
The key to the true interpretation of this passage,
is afforded by Luke 17:22; John <a href="#ch8_21">8:21</a>;
<a href="#ch13_33">13:33</a>. Christ does not refer to an inimical seeking;
the <em>search</em> here is the same as the <em>desire</em> to
see one of the days of the Son of man in Luke
17:22; <i>i. e.</i> the Jewish desire for a manifestation
of the Messiah. He does not refer to a true
spiritual seeking, for in <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch8_21"> 8:21</a> he declares, to
the same Jewish auditors, <cite>Ye shall seek me and ye
shall die in your sins</cite>. Eusebius declares that
many Jews in consequence of the judgments of
God on Jerusalem became believers; such did
indeed seek Christ, but they found him. The
meaning then is that in the coming days of travail
and sorrow, when many should go out after false
Christs (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 24:23, 24</span>), the Jews would earnestly
desire a Messiah for their deliverer, whom, however,
they could not have, because with their
own hands they had put him to death. They
would seek, but theirs would be a temporal, not
a spiritual seeking; the seeking of fear and self-interest,
not of repentance, faith, and love. This
verse affords no authority whatever for the
opinion that any earnest spiritual soul ever seeks
Christ in vain.</p>

<p><b>35, 36. Then said the Jews among themselves.</b>
Their utterance has been by some regarded
as the utterance of a genuine perplexity.
So apparently Maurice: “He had broken down
the barriers between different classes of <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Israelites—between</span>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
Galileans, Samaritans, and Jews.
Why might he not carry his designs further?
Why might he not go to the dispersed tribes in
heathen lands? Why might he not preach to
the heathen themselves?” By others it is regarded
as the language of scorn and contempt.
So Meyer: “An insolent and scornful supposition,
which they themselves, however, do not
deem probable (therefore the question is asked
with <span lang="el">μή</span>), regarding the meaning of words to
them so utterly enigmatical. The bolder mode
of teaching adopted by Jesus, his universalistic
declarations, his partial non-observance of the
law of the Sabbath, would lead them, perhaps,
to associate with the unintelligible statement a
mocking thought like this, and all the more because
much interest was felt among the heathen,
partly of an earnest kind, and partly (<abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Paul in Athens) arising from curiosity merely,
regarding the Oriental religions, especially Judaism.”
The latter view seems to me the more
probable, because (1) it is inconceivable that the
Jews should have misapprehended Christ’s
meaning (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch7_33">33, note</a></span>); (2) his analogous language
in the next chapter they clearly did understand
to refer to his death (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch8_22">8:22</a></span>); (3) the fact that
what was said was “among themselves” indicates
that it was not an honest perplexity, in
which case they would have asked Christ for an
explanation, but of the same quality as the murmuring
reported in verses <a href="#ch7_26">26</a>, <a href="#ch7_27">27</a>.</p>

lasted for seven days (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Leviticus">Lev.</abbr> 23:34, 41, 42</span>), but on the
eighth day a solemn assembly kept as a feast-Sabbath
was directed to be held (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Leviticus">Lev.</abbr> 23:36; <abbr title="Numbers">Numb.</abbr>
29:35; <abbr title="Nehemiah">Neh.</abbr> 8:18</span>); and though the people dwelt
in the booths only the seven days, this eighth
day was reckoned by the Jews as a part of the
feast. Whether the seventh or the eighth is intended
here by the “last day of the feast” is a
little uncertain, as it also is whether the drawing
of water from the brook Siloah, which was a
characteristic ceremonial of the other days of
the feast, took place also on the eighth day.
This ceremonial recalled the miraculous supply
of water in the wilderness from the riven rock;
it was connected by the more superstitious of
the people with the notion that at this time God
determined the amount of rain which should
fall during the year; and the more spiritual saw
in it a symbol of the time when the promised
gift of the Holy Spirit should be bestowed upon
Israel (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 12:3</span>). Whether the words of Christ
were uttered, as Dr. Geikie supposes, during
this ceremonial, or, as Alford supposes, the day
after this service had come to an end, the reference
to it is unmistakable. Dr. Geikie’s supposition
certainly makes this reference more striking,
and gives, if not peculiar significance, at
least peculiar force, to Christ’s words. “The
last day of the feast, known as ‘the Hosanna
Rabba’ and the ‘Great Day,’ found him, as each
day before, doubtless, had done, in the temple
arcades. He had gone thither early, to meet
the crowds assembled for morning prayer. It
was a day of special rejoicing. A great procession
of pilgrims marched seven times round the
city, with their lulabs, music, and loud-voiced
choirs preceding, and the air was rent with
shouts of Hosanna, in commemoration of the
taking of Jericho, the first city in the Holy Land
that fell into the hands of their fathers. Other
multitudes streamed to the brook of Siloah,
after the priests and Levites, bearing the golden
vessels with which to draw some of the water.
As many as could get near the stream drank of
it amidst loud shouting of the words of Isaiah—‘Ho,
every one that thirsteth, come ye to the
waters,’ ‘With joy shall we draw water from the
wells of <span style="white-space:nowrap;">salvation’—rising</span> in jubilant chants on
every side. The water drawn by the priests was,
meanwhile, borne up to the temple, amidst the
boundless excitement of a vast throng. Such a
crowd was, apparently, passing at this moment.
Rising as the throng went by, his spirit was
moved at such honest enthusiasm, yet saddened
at the moral decay which mistook a mere ceremony
for religion. It was burning autumn
weather, when the sun had for months shone in
a cloudless sky, and the early rains were longed
for as the monsoons in India after the summer
heat. Water at all times is a magic word in a
sultry climate like Palestine, but at this moment
it had a double power. Standing, therefore, to
give his words more solemnity, his voice now
sounded far and near over the throng, with soft
clearness, which arrested all: If any man thirst,
let him come unto me and drink.”—(<cite>Geikie.</cite>)—<b>If
any man thirst.</b> This is not an unconditional
promise; it is conditioned, not merely on
desire, but on a fervent desire. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> <abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 55:1;
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:6; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 22:17. “None are called to
obtain the riches of the Spirit but those who
burn with the desire of them. For we know
that the pain of thirst is most acute and tormenting,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
so that the very strongest men, and those
who can endure any amount of toil, are overpowered
by thirst.”—(<cite>Calvin.</cite>) An illustration
of this spiritual thirst is afforded by David in
Psalms 42, 43, and by Paul in <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 3:8-14.—&#8203;<b>Let
him come unto me.</b> If one can imagine these
words spoken to the throng while the procession
is marching into the temple, or even just after
the solemn service is over and the minds of the
people are still full of it, he will form a faint
conception of the divine assumption implied in
them; and if he further considers the effect
produced, both on the multitude (<span class="muchsmaller">verses
<a href="#ch7_40">40</a>, <a href="#ch7_41">41</a></span>) and
on the officers sent to arrest Jesus (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>

will form a faint conception of the divine dignity
with which those words were uttered.</p>

in the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> which directly sustains this citation,
and no reason to suppose that Christ refers
to any lost book. Alford refers to <abbr title="Ezekiel">Ezek.</abbr> 47:1-12,
where the river of the water of life is described
as flowing from under the temple, which Alford
regards as a symbol of the believer; similarly
Olshausen; but both this reference and that to
<abbr title="Zechariah">Zech.</abbr> 14:8 are remote and unnatural. We are
either to suppose that the phrase “as the Scripture
hath said” refers only to the preceding
clause, “he that believeth on me,” so that the
meaning is, He that according to the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> believeth
on me; or else we are to suppose that
John by the following verse (39) not only interprets
the meaning of Christ’s promise, but also the
meaning of his reference, and that we are to look
for the Scripture in those passages which refer
to and promise the gift of the Holy Ghost. The
former of these interpretations is that of Chrysostom,
the latter that of Meyer, who refers to
<abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 44:3; 55:1; 58:1; Joel 3:18; <abbr title="Zechariah">Zech.</abbr> 13:1.—&#8203;<b>Shall
flow rivers of living water.</b> This
declaration is not to be limited so that it shall be
simply equivalent to the promise in John <a href="#ch4_14">4:14</a>,
“Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall
give him shall never thirst.” The language <cite>out
of his belly</cite> clearly implies something received
that it may flow <em>from</em> the recipient unto others.
The water which he drinks becomes in him a
spring from which living waters flow, as the
light which illuminates him makes him in turn
one of the lights which illuminate the world
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:14; <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:15</span>). That this is the meaning is
clear, not only from the language here, but from
John’s interpretation in the succeeding verse.
“The mutual and inspired intercourse of Christians
from Pentecost downwards, the speaking
in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, the mutual
edification in Christian assemblies by means
of the charismata even to the speaking with
tongues, the entire work of the apostles, of a
Stephen and so on, furnish an abundant historical
commentary upon this text.”—(<cite>Meyer.</cite>)</p>

the meaning, for the Holy Ghost was
given before the glorification of Christ, but not
to all men; he was not a universal gift. The
meaning is that the dispensation of the Holy
Ghost had not yet begun; he had not yet been
so given that whoever had faith in the Son of
God received the gift of the Holy Ghost and became
one of the Lord’s prophets (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 2:38</span>). See

on different auditors by Christ’s discourses
at the feast. The word <em>many</em> is wanting
in the best manuscripts, and is omitted by Lachmann,

others thought that he might even be the Messiah.
See <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 31. The opponents of Christ
based their opposition not upon his character or
that of his teaching, but upon their Jewish prejudice
to his supposed Galilean origin. There
is no good ground for the conclusion, arrived at
by some rationalistic critics from John’s language
here, that he did not know that Jesus was
born in Bethlehem. Writing his Gospel many
years after the main facts of Christ’s birth, life,
and death were known throughout the church,
he here simply narrates as an historian the objections
which the Judeans made to the claim
that Jesus was the Messiah; to have pointed out
their mistake would have been a work of supererogation.
Alford’s note on this point is quite
conclusive: “De Wette’s ‘probability that John
knew nothing of the birth at Bethlehem’ reaches
much further than may appear at first. If John
knew nothing of it, and yet the mother of the Lord
lived with him, the inference must be that <em>she</em>
knew nothing of <span style="white-space:nowrap;">it—in</span> other words, that it never
happened.”</p>

They were not overawed by the multitude, but

analogous moral power over roughs who had

knew not the law, and were openly disregarding

See <abbr title="Volume One">Vol. I</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 298. That Nicodemus’ rebuke was

falsehood, <cite>Out of Galilee hath arisen</cite> (perfect, not

<p><a id="Note_Ch8"></a><span class="smcap">Preliminary Note.</span>—Verse
<a href="#ch7_53">53</a> of <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 7 belongs
unquestionably with the first eleven verses of
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 8. Whether the whole passage is really a
part of John’s Gospel or no is one of the most
difficult and doubtful questions in Biblical criticism.
The weight of critical authority is against
it; the weight of internal evidence is in its favor.
For a complete discussion of the considerations
<em>pro</em> and <em>con</em>, the student must be referred to the
commentaries of Alford, Meyer, Luthardt, and
Godet, the last being, of the three, the most
comprehensive in its treatment. Here I give
briefly (1) the facts, (2) the different opinions,
(3) my own conclusion.</p>

<p><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> <i>The facts.</i> (1) The passage in question is
wanting in many if not most of the best <abbr title="Manuscripts">MSS.</abbr>;
pre-eminently the Alexandrian, the Vatican, the
Ephraem, and the Sinaitic. Of the great manuscripts,
the Cambridge alone contains it. (2) It
is transposed in some documents; one places it
in John after <a href="#ch7_36">7:36</a>; ten at the end of John;
four in the Gospel of Luke, at the close of <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 21.
(3) In those <abbr title="Manuscripts">MSS.</abbr> which contain it there are
great variations. Griesbach distinguishes three
entirely different texts; the ordinary text, that
of the Cambridge <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr>, and that resulting from a
collection of other <abbr title="Manuscripts">MSS.</abbr> Alford gives these
three in his Greek Testament. Sixty various
readings are found in these twelve verses. “No
genuine apostolic text has ever undergone such
alterations.”—(<cite>Godet.</cite>) (4) The style and character
of the narrative is strikingly unlike John.
These differences are partly verbal, and are apparent
only to the Greek scholar. Ten expressions
are given by Meyer as non-Johannean.
They are partly structural, and as easily recognized

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
by the English reader as by the Greek
scholar. Such are the propounding of a question
concerning the law to tempt Christ, and the departure
of Christ at night from the temple, both
of which agree rather with the Synoptics’ account
of the last sojourn in Jerusalem than with
John’s account of this period of Christ’s ministry.
If the account is omitted altogether, the
discourse in <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 7 and that in <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 8 appear to be
in close connection; the interruption of this incident
is not very clearly cognate to either discourse;
and it is not John’s habit to narrate
incidents that are not connected with and do not
lead to some discourse of the Lord. (5) Among
the fathers Origen, Chrysostom, Theophylact,
and Tertullian are altogether silent about the
passage; Jerome, Ambrose, and Augustine recognize
it as authentic; among critical scholars
Lucke, Tholuck, Olshausen, De Wette, Luthardt,
Hengstenberg, Schenkel, Godet, Lachmann,
Tischendorf, Alford, and Schaff apparently
agree in regarding it as an addition by some
other hand to John’s Gospel; Bengel and Hilgenfeld
are the only scholars of widely recognized
reputation who defend its Johannean authorship.
(6) But though the narrative is unlike
John, the act is very like Jesus. The whole
scene possesses an air of historic reality: the
arrest of the woman, the demand on Jesus, the
Pharisaic contempt for public morality in obtruding
the crime and the criminal on public
attention in the temple courts; the attempt to
entrap Jesus; the skill of his reply; the subtle
recognition of the woman’s shame and despair,
and the gentle avoidance of adding to it, in turning
the public gaze from her to himself by writing
on the ground; the final confusion of the
Pharisees and release of the woman. It is impossible
to believe that any monkish mind conceived
of this and added it to the narrative. The
deed is the deed of Christ, whether or no the
record is the record of John.</p>

<p><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> <i>Opinions.</i> These are three: (1) That the
narrative belongs here; was written by John,
and was expunged from the Gospel at an early
date because it was feared that an immoral use
would be made of it. This was Augustine’s
opinion. But this hypothesis does not account
for the variety of readings, nor for peculiarities
in character and diction which make it unlike
John’s Gospel. (2) That it is an interpolation of
a later age, for a purpose, by some early copyist.
But the copyist who could have conceived this
incident must have possessed the moral genius
of Christ himself. “It is eminently Christlike,
and full of comfort to penitent outcasts. It
breathes the Saviour’s spirit of holy mercy,
which condemns the sin and saves the sinner.
It is parallel to the parable of the prodigal, the
story of Mary Magdalene, and that of the Samaritan
woman, and agrees with many express
declarations of Christ that he came not to condemn,
but to save the lost (<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch3_17">3:17</a>;
<a href="#ch12_47"> 12:47</a>; Luke
9:56; 19:10; <abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
John <a href="#ch5_14">5:14</a>; Luke 7:37, etc.</span>). His refusal
to act as judge in this case has a parallel in
a similar case related in Luke 12:13-15.”—(<cite>Schaff.</cite>)
(3) That it is a tradition of the apostolic
age, and was incorporated in the present
evangelical narratives, probably in the second or
third century, but in different forms and in different
places. It may have been originally part
of one of the lost Gospels. Eusebius relates that
the work of Papias contained “the history of a
woman accused before the Lord of numerous
sins, a history contained also in the Gospel of the
Hebrews.” This opinion, which is substantially
that of Godet, Meyer, Luthardt, and Alford, accounts
for the existence of the narrative, the
apparent truthfulness of it, the variations of
form, and the non-Johannean characteristics of
style. It seems to me inherently the most probable.
On internal grounds it seems to me clear
that the narrative is historical; on critical
grounds that it is not John’s; who was its author
and how it became incorporated in John’s
Gospel is a matter only of conjecture.</p>

be printed as a single sentence. The auditors
had homes; Jesus had no where to lay his
head; and if, as is probable, this incident belongs
to the Passion week, it was not safe for
him to spend a night within the city walls. He
either spent it on the mount or went beyond it

</div>

<p><b>6. This they said tempting him.</b> The
commentators have been needlessly puzzled to
explain how Christ’s answer to this question
could have furnished matter for accusation.
The Pharisees would have accused him to the
people, not to the Roman government. The law
of Moses was a dead letter. There is no authentic
instance in post-Mosaic history of an execution
under it. Divorce was easy, and the injured
husband generally avoided public disgrace
by simply separating from his unfaithful wife.
Could Christ refuse to adjudge the case? He
had claimed to be King of Israel, in the Sermon
on the Mount, had put his own precepts above
those of Moses, and had proclaimed a far more
stringent law of purity than Moses ever enacted
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:27-32</span>).
Could he acquit her, and so set
aside the Mosaic law? He had declared that not
one jot or tittle of it should pass away till all
was fulfilled, and that whoever relaxed the least
of its precepts should be least in his kingdom.
Could he condemn her? He would thus revive
an obsolete statute, and enforce it against a hapless
and defenceless <span style="white-space:nowrap;">woman—he</span> who had come
to seek and to save the lost, who had received
the publican and harlot among his disciples, and
had accepted the homage of a notorious woman
of the town (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 7:36-39</span>). It often happens that
people are unwilling to have a teacher set aside in
theory a law which they are equally unwilling to
see enforced in practice. Only a small minority
is willing in our own day to abolish capital punishment;
but only rarely is a jury willing to inflict
it. There are comparatively few persons
who are willing to live according to the Sabbath
law which they wish their minister to preach.—&#8203;<b>But
Jesus stooped down and with his

though he heard them not</cite> are an addition of the
translators, though at least one manuscript contains

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
the idea. What was the meaning of this
action? Various opinions have been suggested,
<i>e. g.</i>, a usual act signifying preoccupation of
mind (<cite>Alford</cite>); to hide his own confusion, the
shock to his own moral sensibility by the grossness
of the Pharisees’ public abuse of the woman
(<cite>Geikie</cite>); as a judge, for a judicial sentence is
not only pronounced, but written (<cite>Godet</cite>); as a
refusal to interfere, a sign that he paid no attention
to their question (<cite>Meyer</cite>, <cite>Luthardt</cite>). His
object in this writing seems to me to be interpreted
by its result. It turned all eyes from the
wretched woman, in an anguish of shame and
terror, to himself. She stood alone and forgotten;
all eyes were then and have ever since been
fixed on the figure of Christ, wondering what
and why he wrote in the dust. It is not fanciful
to note the contrast between this writing and
that prescribed in case of the trial of a suspected
adulteress by the Mosaic law (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Numbers">Numb.</abbr> 5:23</span>). The
priest was to write certain curses in a book,
then wash them with bitter water, which the
accused was required to drink, that the curses
might enter into her if she were guilty. Christ,
on the contrary, writes his sentence on the sand,
where, in a moment, it will be effaced by the
pardon, “Neither do I condemn thee; go, and
sin no more.” What he wrote has been made a
matter of ingenious rather than profitable conjecture.
The most probable conjecture is that
he wrote the sentence, “He that is without sin
amongst you,” etc., thus enabling the Pharisees,
if they had not been too passionately intent
on their design, to avoid his public rebuke.</p>

<p><b>7-9. So when they continued asking.</b>
They would not take the rebuke of his quiet
contempt. Had they stopped to think, conscience
would have answered their inquiry; but
they were too eager; they did not hear what it
had to say to them; Christ must interpret its
voice; and he did so with a poignant rebuke.—&#8203;<b>He
that is without sin among you, let
him first cast a stone at her.</b> Christ puts
on them the problem with which they had sought
to perplex him. In their vindictive haste they
had forgotten the provision of the law that the
witnesses on whose testimony the accused was
condemned should cast the first stone (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> 17:5-7</span>).
They had also forgotten the provision of the
Rabbinical law that, in case of accusation, if the
husband was not guiltless, the wife could not be
condemned (<cite>Lightfoot</cite>). Christ recalls these two
principles, and leaves them to solve their own
problem. Go on, he says in effect, and try and
condemn the accused according to your own law.
Let the sinless cast the first stone. But a deeper
meaning is in his words. Unchastity was a universal
sin in the first century. Its extent in Palestine
is illustrated by the licentious lives of the
Herods, father and sons. Nowhere was this vice
more flagrant and unrestrained than among the
priests, whose licentiousness was no secret to
the common people (<span class="muchsmaller">see <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 12:39; James 4:4</span>). It
was this revelation of their own guilt, implied in
the words and easily understood by the people,
which stung them, and drove them, self-condemned,
one by one, from the presence of both
the accused and the judge.—&#8203;<b>And again he
stooped down.</b> To give conscience in them
an opportunity to assert itself, with as little resistance
as possible from pride. He gave them
no opportunity to answer; he did not look to
see who was first to withdraw.—&#8203;<b>Beginning
with the elders.</b> The word rendered eldest
(<span lang="el">πρεσβυτέρων</span>) is almost universally rendered
<cite>elders</cite>, generally as an official designation, and
frequently in connection with the word <cite>ruler</cite>
(<i>e. g.</i>, <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 15:2; 16:21; Mark 8:31; 15:1; Luke 7:3;
22:52</span>). Here it seems to me more probably to
designate rank (<cite>Lucke</cite>, <cite>De Wette</cite>) than age (<cite>Luthardt</cite>,
<cite>Godet</cite>). The leaders in the accusation
were the first to withdraw. The words “even
unto the last” are wanting in most <abbr title="Manuscripts">MSS.</abbr>—<b>Jesus
was left alone.</b> The circle of accusers had
all withdrawn. The people and the disciples
may have still remained; hence the woman is
described as “standing in the midst;” that is,
of the auditors who, before this interruption,
had been listening to the teaching of Jesus
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_2">2</a></span>). The woman remains waiting, as if to receive
the sentence of Jesus. The people remain
waiting to hear the end of this strange episode.</p>

<p class="p2"><abbr title="Chapter">Ch.</abbr> 8:12-20. CHRIST’S DISCOURSE CONCERNING
HIMSELF.—&#8203;<span class="smcap">He is light, liberty, life.—&#8203;He gives
light to those that follow his example, liberty
to those that obey his word, life to those that
put their faith in him.—&#8203;He is attested by his
own character and by his Father’s witness.—&#8203;He
is made known in and by his passion and
death.—&#8203;His Father is the source of his teaching,
his works, and his character.—&#8203;His characterization
of wilful oppugners of the truth:
children of the world; children of the devil.—&#8203;Christ’s
short method with deists</span> (<abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 46). See
note at end of chapter.</p>

<p>The exact chronology of the events from this
point to the close of the tenth chapter is very
uncertain and quite unimportant. One characteristic
feature of the feast of the Tabernacles
was the illumination of the temple; the two
great candelabra of the Court of the Women
were lighted, and it is said in the Rabbinical
hooks that the light shone all over Jerusalem.
Since Christ was accustomed to take his text from
passing events, it is a not improbable surmise
that this illumination afforded the suggestion for
the discourse on the divine light which follows.
The illumination of the temple commemorated
the pillar of fire, as the ceremony of drawing
water (<span class="muchsmaller">see <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch7_37">7:37</a>, etc., notes</span>) commemorated the
striking of the rock in Horeb and the gift of water
from it, and the dwelling in booths recalled the
time when Israel dwelt in tents and booths in the
wilderness. We may therefore see in Christ an antitype
of the fiery cloud that guided Israel in their
pilgrimage, and in the Shechinah filling the Tabernacle
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> 40:34, 35</span>),
an illustration of the light
which Christ imparts to those that follow him.</p>

<p><b>12. I am the light of the world.</b> The
illumination of the temple lighted Jerusalem;
that of the fiery cloud, Israel. Christ is the
light, not merely of his disciples, or of the Jewish
nation, but of the <em>world</em>, a word which here,
as always in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>, stands for the whole human
race. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_4">1:4</a>, <a href="#ch1_9">9</a>, notes. He is the
<em>light</em> as well as the life, coming to instruct as
well as to revive; a Saviour from ignorance as
well as from wilful sin. Therefore no ignorance
or doubt need keep the soul that desires light
away from Christ. He need not wait for instruction,
any more than for reformation, before he
comes to Christ.—&#8203;<b>He that follows me need
not walk in darkness.</b> The best reading is
subjunctive, not indicative. <em>Following Christ</em>,
not believing something about him, is the way
out of darkness into light. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch7_17">7:17</a>, and
note the fact that in no single instance did Christ
call on any one of his disciples to form correct
opinions about him before becoming his follower.
They followed first and learned afterward. Even
he who doubts whether Christ is not a myth can
still follow the ideal life.—&#8203;<b>But shall have the
light of life.</b> That is, the light which guides
and nourishes the true, the spiritual life. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch6_48">6:48</a>, “bread of life.” See <abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 119:105,

not for the illumination of doubtful questions in
science or metaphysics or abstract theology, but
for the solution of practical problems in the
moral and spiritual life.</p>

He may faithfully do from day to day the work

Christ could bear record of himself, for he knew

origin and his own destiny; and he knew the
relation which his life and death sustained to the
world’s life.—&#8203;<b>Ye know not</b> (not merely cannot

itself felt in many ways in Christ’s person, as in
his attraction of publicans and sinners to himself,
his expulsion of the traders from the temple,
his passing through the mob at Nazareth,
etc. Godet tells a story in illustration of the
power of this witness of the Spirit. About 1660,
Hedinger, chaplain to the Duke of Wurtemberg,
took the liberty of censuring his sovereign, at
first in private, but afterward in public, for a
serious fault. The latter, much enraged, sent
for him, resolved to punish him. Hedinger,
after seeking strength by prayer, repaired to the
prince, the expression of his countenance betokening
the peace and the presence of God. The
prince, after looking at him for a moment, asked,
in agitation, “Why did you not come alone?”
and dismissed him unharmed. The vital communion
of this servant of God with his God was
a sensible fact, even to one whom anger had exasperated.

Christ’s reference to God as his Father had been
so frequent at Jerusalem that they could not
have misunderstood his meaning, but in scorn.
Christ’s reply is adapted to the spirit of their
inquiry.—&#8203;<b>Ye neither know me nor my Father.</b>
They gloried in being the peculiar people
of God; but they as little apprehended him
as they did Christ his Son.—&#8203;<b>If ye had known
me ye would have known my Father also.</b>
For the Son is the way to the Father. The converse
of this proposition is also true, He that
knows the Father will know the Son. Both are
known by the spiritual sense; and the same faculty
which appreciates the divine qualities resplendent
in the Son will answer to and be ready
to receive and be impressed by the divine qualities
in the invisible Spirit, the Father whom no
one hath seen or can see.—&#8203;<b>In the treasury.</b>
See Luke 21:1, note. The thirteen trunks or
chests placed for the reception of the gifts of
the worshippers, and properly called the treasury,
were in the Court of the Women. Each
bore an inscription, indicating the use to which
the money placed therein was devoted. Probably
either that part of the Women’s Court where
these chests stood, or, more probably, an adjoining
apartment used in connection with them,
perhaps where the money was kept, was also
designated the treasury, and it is this apartment
that is indicated by the word here.—&#8203;<b>For his

said to each other, partly in perplexity, partly in

but similar spirit in <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch7_35">7:35</a>. Christ, in his
reply, repels the idea that he had referred to his
death; they cannot come where he is going, because
he is going to that heaven from which he
first came, and they are of the earth earthy.
<abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 15:50, “Flesh and blood cannot
inherit the kingdom of God.”—&#8203;<b>Ye are from

is interpreted by the clause which follows.—&#8203;<b>Ye
are of</b> (<em>from</em>, <span lang="el">ἐκ</span>) <b>this world, I am not of</b>
(<em>from</em>, <span lang="el">ἐκ</span>) <b>this world</b>. Man is born of the flesh,
and therefore is flesh, needing to be born anew
and from above in order to enter into the kingdom
of heaven (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch3_5">3:5</a>, <a href="#ch3_6">6</a></span>). Christ was born, even
in his earthly nature, of the Spirit (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 1:35</span>), was
from his birth the Son of God, and therefore did
not need to experience the new birth. Though
John does not describe his supernatural birth,
he recognizes it. Christ’s language here would
be incomprehensible but for the interpretation
afforded by the narratives of his advent in Matthew
and Luke. The declaration “Ye are from
beneath” here is not equivalent to the declaration
of <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_44">44</a>, “Ye are of your father the devil.”
Here he speaks only of the earthly nature inherited;
there of the wilful sin superadded.—&#8203;<b>If ye
believe not that I am, ye shall die in your
sins.</b> In the phrase “I am” there is a reference
to <abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> 3:14, and the language implies the
divinity of Christ, and would be so understood
by his Jewish auditors, and was so understood
by them. See <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_38">38</a>
and note. But it is not
equivalent to a general statement that belief in
the divinity of Jesus Christ is essential to salvation.
It was addressed to men who had abundant
reason to believe that Christ was the divine
Messiah of prophecy, and who were wilfully
ignorant of the truth. We must not give the
words any wider application than our Lord gave
to them himself. To reject Christ is fatal; to be
ignorant of him is not.</p>

partly in perplexity and partly in scorn,

The principal interpretations are: (1)
<cite>What I from the beginning am teaching you? do
you ask that?</cite> An interrogative expression of
surprise. According to this view Christ does not
answer the question at all. (2) <cite>Why indeed do I
still speak to you at all?</cite> A language of reproach.
(3) <cite>Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning</cite>,
the rendering of our English version.
(4) <cite>Essentially that which also I discourse to you</cite>;

<p><b>26, 27. Many things I have which I

might pronounce concerning you.</b> The
meaning and the connection is obscure, and the
translation which I have given is not so literal as
that of the English version. But Christ elsewhere
declares that he has not come to judge
the world (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch8_15">15</a>; <abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr>
<a href="#ch3_17">3:17</a>; <a href="#ch12_47">12:47</a></span>), and to understand
him here to assert the contrary makes his
utterances contradictory. Moreover, if we interpret
his declaration as the English version
does, it is difficult to see any connection with the
preceding or the subsequent clause. I understand
therefore that he means that he <em>has</em> many
things to say, and many judgments formed in
his own mind, which he might pronounce, but
that he will only speak those things which he has
been commissioned by the Father to speak; and
his commission at this time is not to judge, but
to save the world.—&#8203;<b>They understood not
that he spake to them of the Father.</b>
Strange! Less strange, perhaps, than it now
seems to us, for we read this discourse in the
light of eighteen centuries of Christianity. So
far, too, Christ had not designated by any title

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
the One who had sent him. He had veiled his
meaning, as he did in the parables, that he might
not be fully understood at once; for he could
hope to get lodgment for the truth only by gradually
unfolding it. “There is no accounting for
the <em>ignorance of unbelief</em> as any minister of Christ
knows by painful experience.”—(<cite>Alford.</cite>)</p>

<p><b>28-30. When ye have lifted up the Son
of man.</b> The phrase Son of man was used by
the rabbis, who borrowed it from David, for the
Messiah (<span class="muchsmaller">see
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 10:23, note</span>). The Greek verb here
rendered <dfn>lifted up</dfn> (<span lang="el">ὑψόω</span>) is used by John only
with reference to the crucifixion (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr>
<a href="#ch3_14">3:14</a>; <a href="#ch8_28">8:28</a>;
<a href="#ch12_32">12:32</a>, <a href="#ch12_34">34</a></span>),
but everywhere else in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> is used
in the sense of <dfn>exalted</dfn>, and is so translated except
in James 4:10. See <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 11:23; Luke 1:52;
Acts 2:33; 5:31, etc. This fact is of itself an
indication that John’s Gospel was written after
the cross had been seen to be the means by
which Christ was himself exalted, his glory, not
his shame. It is the cross which has led to his
recognition among men as the Son of God (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark
15:39; 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 1:23, 24</span>); to his exaltation by the Father
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:8-10</span>); to his adoration in heaven (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr>
5:12</span>).—&#8203;<b>Ye shall know that I am.</b> See on
<abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_24">24</a>. The passion and death of Christ is the
attestation of his divinity (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 15:39</span>).—&#8203;<b>I do
nothing of myself; but as the Father hath
taught me I speak these things.</b> In Christ’s
time the things <em>done</em>, <i>i. e.</i>, the miracles, were
recognized as signs of divine presence and power;
more and more the <em>words spoken</em> are recognized
as still greater signs of the divine presence
and power. The word is more than the external
work, the truth is greater than the miracle.—&#8203;<b>He
that sent me is with me.</b> The Son is a
manifestation of the Father, because the Father
is ever in and working and speaking through the
Son. He is not merely an ambassador sent by,
he is a tabernacle in which dwells, the Eternal
King. So Christ, who sends forth his disciples
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_18">17:18</a></span>), is ever with them
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_17">14:17</a>, <a href="#ch14_23">23</a>;
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 28:20</span>).—&#8203;<b>The
Father hath not left me alone; for
I do those things that please him always.</b>
<em>Always</em> is emphatic. In this uniformity of obedience
to the Father’s will is the secret of the
abiding of his presence; it is true for us, as for
Christ, that doing the Father’s pleasure secures
the divine fellowship (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_21">14:21</a>; <a href="#ch15_10">15:10</a></span>).—&#8203;<b>Many
believed on him.</b> <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch12_42">12:42</a>. Faith,
like knowledge, is of different degrees, and the
quality of this faith is not indicated. It may
have been like the seed received on stony places
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 13:20, 21</span>). But beware of understanding
here, or anywhere, by this phrase a mere intellectual
belief in Christ as either Rabbi, Prophet,
or Messiah. To <em>believe on</em> always signifies an
emotion or heart action. “Our Lord’s words
did not appeal to the understanding; they were
not argumentative; we cannot account for their
influence by any processes of logic. So far as we
can judge from a very simple statement, they
went straight to the heart; the faith which they
called forth was a faith of the heart.”—(<cite>Maurice.</cite>)</p>

“They should <span style="white-space:nowrap;">be—what?</span> Saints? divines? doctors?

the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">three—what</span> all the three should wish to be

progressive theology; the promise to his followers
is not that they shall be learned, acquiring the
truth once for all, but learners, ever acquiring it
more and more. This promise is conditioned <span style="white-space:nowrap;">on—what?</span>
Receiving his word? defending his
word? No; but abiding in his word, <i>i. e.</i>, living,
moving, and having their being in it. The
word of Christ cannot be accepted once for all;
the soul, to be nourished on it, must abide in it,

is the condition precedent to a true apprehension
of the truth. Christ teaches that life precedes
creed; the church has too often reversed this,
making the creed precede life. But a creed that
does not grow out of spiritual experience is
dead. There is no virtue in the doctrine of native
depravity except as an outgrowth of personal
humility; nor in belief in a personal God,
except as it is rooted in a living experience of

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
faith in him.—&#8203;<b>And the truth shall make
you free.</b> This, too, the church has often reversed,
bringing men into bondage unto a creed,
instead of using the creed as an instrument to
enlarge their intellectual independence.—&#8203;<b>We
be Abraham’s seed, and were never in
bondage to any one.</b> This is the language of
pride, and it is not more true than the language
of pride is ordinarily. Politically the nation had
been in bondage to Babylon, Persia, Greece,
Rome. Spiritually it had been in bondage to
idolatries in past times, <i>e. g.</i>, the reign of Manasseh,
and was now in bondage to the rabbis, literalists
in interpretation, and without spirituality
or sympathy (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 23:4</span>). Christ, however, rarely
enters into argument; he makes no attempt to
refute their statement, pays no heed to their interruption,
but goes on with his discourse.</p>

<p><b>34-36. Whosoever committeth sin</b> (lives
in the commission of sin) <b>is the slave</b> (not servant)
<b>of sin</b>. He is in bondage to sin. For action
forms habit, and habit becomes second
nature. Thus every sinful act tends to bring the
soul into bondage to the law of evil habit.
Striking illustrations of this law of human nature
are afforded by self-indulgence in appetite; but
the same principle is involved in all <span style="white-space:nowrap;">evil-doing—it</span>
tends to fasten evil habits on the soul. See
<abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 6:16-18; 7:9-24. And this law belongs
to human nature; it is equally operative in Jew
and Gentile, in church-member and in man of
the world. Every sin helps to weld a chain.—&#8203;<b>The
slave abideth not in the house forever,
but the Son abideth ever.</b> The language
is parabolic; the meaning seems to me to
be this: The world is in bondage; it <em>seems</em> to be
under Satan; his promise to Christ, “All these
things will I give thee if thou wilt fall down and
worship me,” appears not like a vain promise.
But this bondage is short-lived. The kingdoms
of the world are <em>in truth</em> the kingdoms of the
Lord and of his Christ. He shall reign forever
and forever (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 11:15</span>). He, therefore, who
yields to the yoke of bondage by conforming to
the world gets only a brief advantage, for the
period of bondage to sin and Satan will soon be
over. He that accepts Christ as his Lord, and
acknowledges allegiance to him, will have an
eternal freedom in the house which God has
built, and over which Christ is to have eternal
rule (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 3:2-6</span>). The world is God’s house, not
Satan’s.—&#8203;<b>If the Son therefore shall make
you free.</b> From past penalty, by himself bearing
it for us; from the bondage of sin, by giving
us power to become the sons of God; from the
law, by imparting to us a new spiritual life.
See Paul’s Epistle to the Galatians, especially
<abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr> 4 and 5, which may be regarded as his sermon
on this text.—&#8203;<b>Ye shall be free indeed.</b>
Made free by the <em>truth</em> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch8_32">32</a></span>) as it is in Christ
Jesus. For freedom is not independence of all
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">law—that</span> never is and never can be; God himself
is not thus free; it is the comprehension
and the right use of law. We are free when we
perfectly comprehend the laws of nature, <i>i. e.</i>, of
God, perfectly and cheerfully comply with them,
and so know how to get the advantage and profit
of them. All progress in material civilization
has been attained by increasing knowledge of
the divine laws, and consequently an increased
use of them. We have yet to learn the gain that
there is in a similar comprehension of and obedience
to the intellectual and the spiritual laws
of the universe. Thus it is that the <em>truth</em> makes
<em>free</em> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>

<p><b>37, 38. I know that ye are Abraham’s

yourselves as Abraham’s seed</em>. The reference is to
the covenant with Abraham (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 12:1-3; 17:4-8</span>),
which involved a promise of divine protection
and blessing to the nation. The Pharisees adhere
to the idea of political freedom. Christ
assents to their declaration that they are the
seed referred to in that covenant, but returns to
the spiritual idea which underlies his discourse,
and emphasizes the extent to which, in character,
they have wandered from the pattern set by
Abraham.—&#8203;<b>Nevertheless</b> (<span lang="el">ἀλλὰ</span>, notwithstanding
you are Abraham’s seed) <b>ye seek to kill
me</b> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr>

<a href="#ch10_31">10:31</a>, <a href="#ch10_39">39</a></span>). To whom
were these words <span style="white-space:nowrap;">spoken?—to</span> the believing
Judeans mentioned in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch8_30">30</a>, or to enemies?
The true answer is that believers and unbelievers
were intermixed in the crowd, and that it is as
little possible for the reader now as it would
have been for the observer then to distinguish
between them.—&#8203;<b>Because my word makes no
progress in you.</b> They heard <span style="white-space:nowrap;">it—nay,</span> crowded
round him to hear it, were willing and interested
listeners. But the truth did not get entrance
into their hearts, nor permeate their character.
It was not like the leaven hid in three measures
of meal. They were thus a type of many
modern hearers who listen to the truth, but in
whom the truth does not work. The words rendered
<cite>hath no place</cite> (<span lang="el">οὐ χωρεῖ</span>) signify, literally,
does not <dfn>work, spread, go forward</dfn>.—&#8203;<b>I do that
which I have seen with my Father, and

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
ye do that which ye have heard with your
father</b> (<span lang="el">ἠκούσατε</span>, <em>heard</em>, not <span lang="el">ἑωράκατε</span>, <em>seen</em>, is the
better reading). Christ approaches a truth whose
depths, in our ignorance of the spirit world, we
cannot sound. This is that every soul draws its
inspiration from an invisible <span style="white-space:nowrap;">world—either</span> belongs
to the kingdom of light and is taught of
God, or belongs to the kingdom of darkness and
is taught of evil spirits. The unseen companions
of the soul are the most influential. Demoniacal
possession is only an exceptional fruitage
of a universal demoniacal inspiration. See below,

recognize, as we all recognize, that there is a
source from which are drawn the ideas and the
influences which mould our character. This
fountain is, according to their conception, Abrahamic.
It is true that character is moulded by
national influences; but these are not the profoundest
nor the most potent.—&#8203;<b>If ye were

They do not do that which they have heard from

<p><b>41, 42. Ye do the deeds of your father.</b>
A generic truth; the spiritual paternity of any
soul may be known by its deeds; the source of
its life is witnessed by the life itself.—&#8203;<b>We be
not born of fornication.</b> It is a Jewish
legend to this day that Jesus was born of adultery.
This is the Jewish explanation of his premarital
birth. I believe that this legend had
been invented in Christ’s own time to account
for his supernatural birth, and that the expression
here is a scornful allusion to this dishonoring
report. This, at least, though I do not find
it suggested by any of the commentaries, seems
to me the most natural explanation of the language
of the Pharisees, which has given the
scholars no little difficulty. Other explanations
suggested—<i>e. g.</i>, that Sarah was not an adulteress,
and therefore the Jews were certainly children
of Abraham (<cite>Meyer</cite>), or that, unlike the
Samaritans, there was no taint of heathen blood
in their veins (<cite>Alford</cite>, <span style="white-space:nowrap;"><cite>Godet</cite>)—seem</span> to me unnatural
and far-fetched, and are apparently not very
satisfactory even to those who suggest them.—&#8203;<b>We
have one Father, even God.</b> They
abandon their claim to have derived their life
from Abraham, and substitute a claim to derive
it from the God of Abraham. Or we may suppose
that, the first interlocutors being silenced,
others make this assertion.—&#8203;<b>If God were your
Father ye would love me.</b> The practical
and present application is that every soul whose
life is truly rooted in God will be drawn toward
Christ by spiritual sympathy.—&#8203;<b>For I came
forth and am here from God.</b> The first verb
(<span lang="el">ἐξῆλθον</span>) indicates Christ’s <em>coming forth</em> from the
glory which Christ had with the Father from the
beginning of the world (<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch17_5">17:5</a></span>); the second
verb (<span lang="el">ἥκω</span>, present formed from a perfect) indicates
the <em>perpetual presence</em> of the Father with
Christ, and Christ’s continuous manifestation of
the Father to the world.—&#8203;<b>Neither came I
of myself.</b> Therefore that phase of theology
which represents the Son as interceding to make
a just God merciful, and thus induce him to forgive
the sinful, is thoroughly false. The mercy
of Christ originated with the Father; the mission
of Christ was wrought out by the Father.
Christ came not of his own will, but of the Father’s.

<p><b>43, 44. Why do ye not understand my
speech?</b> He has thus far spoken parabolically,
as though reluctant to characterize them openly
as children of the devil. He now abandons the
dark saying, and speaks plainly.—&#8203;<b>Even because
ye cannot hear my word.</b> <em>Word</em> is the doctrine
taught, <em>speech</em> is the form in which it is
clothed; to <em>hear</em> is to receive with the heart, as
in <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 13:16, 20;
John <a href="#ch5_24">5:24</a>; <a href="#ch8_47">8:47</a>, etc.; to
<em>understand</em> is to comprehend intellectually. The
implication then is that he who is unwilling to
receive and act upon the doctrine of Christ in
his heart and life cannot comprehend the forms
in which it is couched. The declaration is thus
the converse of <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch7_17">7:17</a>.—&#8203;<b>Ye are from your
father the devil.</b> God is the Father of Christ,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
and of all those who through faith in Christ are
born again; they become by adoption his children
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:15-17</span>), are sent into the world by their
Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch17_18">17:18</a></span>), and manifest their Father unto
the world (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:15</span>). In like manner they that
resist the truth are children, by their own choice,
of the devil, commissioned by him, serving him,
and manifesting his spirit, in their selfishness,
cupidity, malice, and all uncharitableness. In
each case the soul derives its spirit from its own
chosen father. The whole contrast would be
almost meaningless if by the devil Christ understood
only a poetic personification of evil in human
nature. There are two households, one of
God, the other of Satan; two churches, one of
truth and love, the other of falsehood and malignity.
“This verse is one of the most decisive
testimonies for the objective personality of the
devil. It is quite impossible to suppose an accommodation
to Jewish views, or a metaphorical
form of speech, in so solemn and direct an assertion
as this.”—(<cite>Alford.</cite>)—<b>The will</b> (lusts is too
narrow a word; the original signifies earnest desire,
but generally of a bad sort) <b>of your father
ye are determined to do</b>. Literally, <em>will to
do</em>. Resolute determination to evil is clearly
indicated by the form of the sentence (<span lang="el">θέλετε
ποιεῖν</span>). The language of Christ here, therefore,
does not apply to sins of ignorance and inattention.
He is speaking to wilful opposers of the
truth.—&#8203;<b>He was a murderer from the beginning.</b>
Not because he inspired Cain’s murder
of his brother Abel, but because, from the very
outset, he endeavored to seduce into disobedience,
and so to destroy, the human race. His declaration
“Ye shall not surely die” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 3:4</span>) was not
merely a lie, but a lie having for its object the
death of mankind.—&#8203;<b>Stood not in the truth.</b>
It seems to me that there is here a reference to
the fall of the devil. So Augustine and the Roman
Catholic commentators generally; <i lang="la">contra</i>,
Meyer, Alford, and the moderns. Satan was in
a high position, but he did not <em>stand</em>, because
truth was not his foundation, and—<b>Because
truth is not in him</b>. No definite article is
appended to <em>truth</em> here. Satan did not <em>stand</em>
on the truth of God, because in him, in his
inner character, truth found no place. We can
only stand <em>by</em> the truth when truth is in <em>our inward
parts</em> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 51:6</span>), <i>i. e.</i>, in our desires and our
affections. The truth must be <em>in</em> us to be <em>under</em>
us.—&#8203;<b>He speaketh of his own.</b> Out of (<span lang="el">ἐκ</span>)
his own treasury of evil things. So the evil man,
out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth evil
things (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 12:35</span>).—&#8203;<b>For he is a liar, and the
father of it.</b> Or <em>of him</em>; either the father of
<em>lying</em> or the father of the <em>liar</em>. Either rendering
is grammatically possible. The latter better fits
the context.</p>

<em>because</em>; it has its ground in the alien character
of the relation between that which Jesus speaks
and their devilish nature, to which latter a lie
alone corresponds.”—(<cite>Meyer.</cite>) Truth has not
always its evidence in human nature; for human

believe a lie than the truth (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 1:21; <abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 4:18;
2 <abbr title="Thessalonians">Thess.</abbr> 2:11</span>). If Christ had told a lie they would
have believed him, just as many of those who
now rejected him did subsequently believe the
false Christs of a later date.—&#8203;<b>Which of you
convinceth me of sin.</b> Not of <em>error</em> (<cite>Calvin</cite>),
but of <em>sin</em> (<cite>Alford</cite>, <cite>Godet</cite>, <cite>Meyer</cite>). Indeed, <em>error</em>
in Christ’s teaching in this matter would be <em>sin</em>;
for if his declaration respecting himself, that he
came not from the earth but from above, from
the Father, and was the long-anticipated Messiah,
was not true, it would have been false and
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">fraudulent—not</span> merely a mistake, but a lie. By
this question he asserts, by implication, his sinlessness;
he defies his opponents to point out a
single sin in his life, a single flaw in his character.
And they were speechless, as scepticism
has been ever since, before his incomparable
character. The argument is this: If I am not
the Son of God, find out some human defect that
indicates a human origin and kinship. And this
has never been done. I imagine a pause, a moment’s
expressive silence, no answer from the
Pharisees, and then the crushing words that follow,
calmly uttered:—<b>If I say the truth, why
do ye not believe?</b>—&#8203;<b>He that is of God</b>—as
the Pharisees had claimed to be
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_41">41</a></span>)—<b>heareth</b>
(receiveth) <b>God’s words; ye therefore
hear them not, because ye are not of God</b>.
This is Christ’s method with deists. Point out a
single flaw in his stainless character. You cannot?
Then at least listen with reverent attention
to the words of the sinless man. To refuse
a hearing to such an one demonstrates hostility
to purity and truth, and so to God.</p>

argument by calling names. <em>Devil</em> is an unfortunate
translation, giving the English reader the
impression that they use the same word which
Christ has used in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_44">44</a>. Their word is <dfn>demon</dfn>
(<span lang="el">δαιμόνιον</span>), and signifies primarily, in classic
usage, a tutelary demon or genius; in <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
usage, an evil spirit. These spirits are represented
as fallen angels (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 2:4; Jude 6</span>), subject to
Satan (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 9:34; 25:41; 2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 12:7; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 12:9</span>), possessing
the power of working miracles (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 16:14</span>),
dwelling in the idols of the heathen and uttering
the heathen responses and oracles (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 16:17; 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr>
10:20; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 9:20</span>), and the authors of evil to mankind
(<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 12:7; 1 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 4:1</span>). See <cite><abbr title="Robinson's Lexicon">Rob. Lex.</abbr></cite>, art.
<span lang="el">δαιμόνιον</span>. The charge had before been made by
the Pharisees that Christ cast out devils by
Beelzebub the prince of devils (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 12:24</span>). It is
not necessary to trace any connection between
the two epithets <cite>a Samaritan</cite> and <cite>possessing a
demon</cite>. Passion is never coherent. The language
is wild, bitter, passionate, but illogical
and inconsequential.—&#8203;<b>I have not a devil *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
ye do dishonor me.</b> He passes by
the charge of being a Samaritan in silence, for
the author of the parable of the Good Samaritan
refuses to recognize opprobrium in it; he calmly
denies the charge of having a demon, and declares
that by the discourses which they attribute
to a demon he honors the Father, while they
dishonor him. Peter’s declaration (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 2:23</span>),
“Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again,
but committed himself to him that judgeth
righteously,” is illustrated by Christ’s response
here. Contrast his indignation at the wrong
done to others (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 23:14, 15, 23, etc.</span>) with his mildness
when wrong is done to himself. And the
next verse gives the secret reason of his calmness.—&#8203;<b>I
am not seeking my own glory.</b>
Therefore he is comparatively indifferent to
public abuse and dishonor.—&#8203;<b>There is one who
seeks and judges.</b> Because God cares for the
honor of his children, they can well be unconcerned
respecting it; because God judges them
righteously, they can well disregard the unrighteous
judgments of men.</p>

</div>

<p><b>51. Verily, verily.</b> With Calvin and Godet,
I regard Christ’s discourse to his opponents
as ended with the preceding verse. Recognizing
the fact that some of his auditors have been
inclined toward him, though with but a feeble
faith, he addresses them in the words that follow,
that he may strengthen their faith. The connection
which Alford and Meyer endeavor to trace
between this and the preceding verse I cannot
perceive: <i>e. g.</i>, “Ye are now the children of the
devil; but if ye keep my word ye shall be rescued
from that murderer.”—(<cite>Alford.</cite>) The very
words with which Christ begins the sentence,
“Verily, verily” (<span lang="el">ἀμὴν, ἀμὴν</span>) indicate a new
topic.—&#8203;<b>If any one.</b> Emphasis is put on the
pronoun. The promise is universal; it embraces
Jew and Gentile.—&#8203;<b>Keep my word.</b> <em>Keep</em>, as
a guard his prisoner, with watchfulness (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
19:17, note</span>), against all seductions and assaults;
<em>Christ’s word</em>, that which he had taught, and therefore
pre-eminently that faith in him as a divine
Saviour which had been the pre-eminent theme of
his teaching. We are to keep not merely the <em>sayings</em>
in <em>memory</em>, or the <em>teaching</em> in the <em>heart</em>, but,
with sentiments of reverence and affection, the
<em>truth</em> in our <em>life</em>, both in the inward experience
and in the outward conduct.—&#8203;<b>Shall not see
death for ever.</b> Not, <em>Shall not see eternal death</em>,
but, <em>Shall never see death</em>. “The death of the
body is not reckoned as death, any more than
the life of the body is life, in our Lord’s discourses.

<b>54-56. If I glorify myself my glory is
nothing.</b> To <dfn>honor</dfn> or <dfn>glorify</dfn> (<span lang="el">δοξάζω</span>) is to attribute
honor, generally by words. Christ’s reply
to the question, <cite>Whom makest thou thyself?</cite> is that
he makes nothing of himself; he leaves others
to interpret his character from his life and teachings.
And this is singularly true; Christ is to
each soul what its spiritual sight is able to discern
in him. He does not declare himself.—&#8203;<b>It is
my Father that glorifieth me.</b> He leaves
his reputation in the hands of his Father, an example
to his followers when belied and misrepresented.
See on <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_18">18</a>.—&#8203;<b>Ye have never
learned him, but I know him.</b> There is a
double contrast in the two verbs (<span lang="el">γινώσκω</span> and
<span lang="el">οἶδα</span>), the one signifying acquired, the other
direct intuitive knowledge; and in the tenses,
the one signifying a past act, <em>never have known</em>,
the other a perpetually present possession, <em>I
always know</em>. The sense may be expressed: <cite>Ye
have never acquired any knowledge of God, but I
am always in fellowship with him.</cite>—<b>I should be
a liar like unto you.</b> To boast of one’s spiritual
experience is to glorify one’s self; such
glory is nothing. To deny it, under pretence of
humility, is to become a liar. There may be
hypocrisy in disavowing the sense of God’s presence
and love, as well as in falsely pretending to
it. The true method is that of Christ, who
showed it by his life, not by his professions.—&#8203;<b>Your
father Abraham exulted that he
might see my day</b> (<i>i. e.</i>, that it was promised
to him); <b>and he has seen it and was glad</b>.
There is some difficulty in the interpretation of
this passage, to which I have given a literal
translation. Some scholars regard it as wholly
prophetical, “Abraham rejoiced in anticipation
of Christ’s advent;” others as historical but
typical, “He rejoiced, seeing in the birth of Isaac
a type of the advent of the Messiah,” and they
even suppose that Christ refers to Abraham’s
laughter (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 17:17</span>); still others interpret it as
partly prophetic and partly historical, “He rejoiced
in anticipation of the promised advent;
he has since seen it from his home in paradise,
and was glad.” The latter view seems to me
best to accord with the original and with the
context. So Godet, Meyer, Alford. For a statement
of different views, see <cite>Meyer</cite>. The declaration
is responsive to the question, Art thou
greater than our father Abraham? The answer
is, Your father Abraham rejoiced because he was
promised that he should see my advent, and the
realization of his hope has given him new joy in
the heavenly kingdom. If this interpretation be
correct, the language incidentally confirms the
doctrine that the saints in heaven are cognizant
of what passes upon earth.</p>

<p><b>57-59. The Judeans therefore said to
him, Thou art not yet fifty years old.</b>
No indication of his actual age. The fifty years
was specified because this was the age of a perfected
maturity, according to Jewish notions
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Numbers">Numb.</abbr> 4:3, 39; 8:24—Lightfoot</span>).—&#8203;<b>And hast thou
seen Abraham?</b> He did not say that he had,
but that Abraham had seen him. They pervert
his words, partly through stupidity, partly
through wilfulness.—&#8203;<b>Verily, verily.</b> The precursor
of a specially solemn declaration.—&#8203;<b>Before
Abraham was born, I am</b> (<span lang="el">γίγνομαι-εἰμί</span>).
Two Socinian explanations are afforded of this
passage: (1) Before Abraham was born I (Christ)
existed in the divine counsels, <i>i. e.</i> I was purposed
by God and foretold by him; (2) Before
Abram can become Abraham, a spiritual father
of nations, I (Christ) must be sent forth as the
Messiah. They both seem to me to be shifts
devised to accommodate Scripture to a theological
preconception. All independent Greek
scholars (Meyer, Luthardt, Alford, Godet, Tholuck,
etc.) agree substantially in their interpretation
of the language. Its meaning is made clear
by a consideration of the original Greek, in which
the contrast is strongly marked between Abraham,
who began to be, and Christ, who eternally
is; by the context, in which the pre-eminence of
Christ above Abraham is clearly implied; by the
unexpressed but hardly doubtful reference to
the appellation given by the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> to Jehovah as
the <span class="smcap">I am</span> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> 3:14;
<abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 14:27;
Mark 6:50; 14:62;
John <a href="#ch8_24">8:24</a>, <a href="#ch8_25">25</a></span>); and by the interpretation which was
put upon Christ’s words by his auditors, who
understood them as a claim of divinity, and took
up stones to stone him as a blasphemer. Christ,
then, by these words, as I understand him, identifies
himself, as the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> manifestation of the
unseen God, with the <span class="smcap">I am</span> of the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>, the One
who had manifested the Invisible to Israel in all
their history.—&#8203;<b>Then took they up stones to
cast at him.</b> The building of the temple was

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
still going on, and stones were probably lying
about in the temple court. Stoning was the
<abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> punishment for blasphemy, but it could
not be lawfully inflicted without trial and judgment.—&#8203;<b>Jesus
hid himself.</b> There is no good
ground to suppose any miraculous escape, either
here or in Luke 4:30. And there is good reason
to believe that there was not a miraculous interposition,
for Christ never availed himself of any
miracle for his own benefit. See <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 4:6,
note. The clause “going through the midst of
them, and so passed by,” is wanting in the best
<abbr title="Manuscripts">MSS.</abbr>, and is omitted by Alford, Meyer, Godet,
Luthardt. The latter traces a curious analogy
between this typical expulsion and the final crucifixion
of Christ. He hides himself from the
eyes of those whom the God of this world has
blinded; he leaves the Pharisees apparent victors
and in possession of the field; in taking up
stones to stone him they show themselves to be
murderers at heart, as they afterward became in
outward act.</p>

<p>In this discourse, or these discourses, for it is
not quite clear whether it is one or more, the
connection is sometimes obscure, and the meaning
accordingly difficult. The student must remember
(1) that Christ addresses a very different
audience from that in Galilee. There he spoke
to willing but ignorant disciples; in Jerusalem
he speaks to obstinate and perverse enemies.
(2) Hence the difference in spirit. In Galilee
gentleness is predominant, in Jerusalem severity.
(3) The continuity of the discourse is affected
by the sudden transitions of feeling in
Christ, which are great, as in all natures of deep
and ready sympathy. He speaks now with great
pathos, as in the question, a semi-soliloquy, Why
do ye not understand my speech?
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_43">43</a></span>), then
with indignation, Ye are of your father the devil
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_44">44</a></span>);
now with self-abnegation, I judge no
man (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_15">15</a></span>),
If I honor myself my honor is nothing
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_54">54</a></span>), again with divine self-assertion and
the power of an unconcealed divinity, I am from
above (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_23">23</a></span>),
 Before Abraham was I am (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_58">58</a></span>).
(4) The continuity of his speech is constantly
broken in upon by rude interruptions (<span class="muchsmaller">verses <a href="#ch8_19">19</a>, <a href="#ch8_22">22</a>,
<a href="#ch8_39">39</a>, <a href="#ch8_41">41</a>,

<a href="#ch8_53">53</a>, <a href="#ch8_57">57</a></span>), and by changes in the direction
of his discourse, which is sometimes addressed
to his disciples (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_31">31</a></span>),
and sometimes to his opponents
(<span class="muchsmaller">verses <a href="#ch8_42">42</a>, <a href="#ch8_49">49</a>,
etc.</span>). (5) Nevertheless we may
say generally that the discourse embodies
Christ’s teaching respecting himself, and embraces
the following points: He is (<i>a</i>) the light,
<i>i. e.</i>, the moral and spiritual illuminator, of the
world (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_12">12</a></span>);
(<i>b</i>) superhuman in his origin (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch8_23">23</a></span>); (<i>c</i>) the manifestation of the Father, because
the tabernacle (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch1_14">1:14</a></span>)
in which the Father
dwells (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_29">29</a></span>); (<i>d</i>) the emancipator of all those
that accept and obey the truth as manifested by
him (<span class="muchsmaller">verses <a href="#ch8_31">31-36</a></span>);
(<i>e</i>) sinless (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_46">46</a></span>);
(<i>f</i>) the life-giver
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_51">51</a></span>);
(<i>g</i>) the great <span class="smcap">I am</span> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch8_58">58</a></span>). To receive
the benefit of the light which he confers,
we must follow his example (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_12">12</a></span>);
to receive
the benefit of the freedom he brings, we must
live habitually in the truth which he teaches
(<span class="muchsmaller">verses <a href="#ch8_31">31</a>,
<a href="#ch8_32">32</a></span>); to receive the life which he bestows,

<p><a id="Note_ch9"></a><span class="smcap">Preliminary Note.</span>—This miracle is reported
only by John. There is nothing peculiar in this,
since John alone reports Christ’s Judean ministry,
in which it occurred. The place was Jerusalem;
the time is uncertain; it was on a Sabbath
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>

the feast of Tabernacles in October

the feast of Dedication in December
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch10_22">10:22</a></span>).
Some identify it with the last day of the former
feast (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch7_37">7:37</a></span>), which was a Sabbath, supposing
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch7_53">7:53</a>
to <a href="#ch8_11">8:11</a> to be an interpolation. It
is not probable that it occurred at the time
which seems to be indicated by its place in
the report furnished by the Evangelists. That
Christ stopped on escaping from a mob who
threatened to stone him, in order to work this
miracle, is not probable; that under such circumstances
his disciples should have asked him
the abstruse question of <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch9_2">2</a> is still more improbable.
I put it therefore at some other time
in his Judean ministry, which lasted a little over
two months. See <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 7,

of this verse with the last verse of the

that verse is of doubtful authenticity. The

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>

simply to indicate that the miracle of mercy was
called forth by the occasion, not by the blind

purpose. “It was he who saw the blind man,
not the blind man who came to him; and so earnestly
did he look upon him that even his disciples
perceived it.”—(<cite>Chrysostom.</cite>) Compare this
case with that in Luke 18:35-43. There the
blind man appeals to Christ, here Christ heals
without being appealed to. There, in the stillness
of the country, the noise of the multitude
awakens the attention of the blind man. Here,
in the crowded city, there is nothing to announce
to the blind man a healer until Christ speaks to
him. There, therefore, he awaits the petition;
here he does not. Congenital blindness is incurable
by modern science. How it was known to
the Evangelist that this man was blind from his
birth has been questioned. The man appears,
from the following narrative, to have been a
well-known mendicant. Perhaps he proclaimed
the nature and extent of his misfortune as a
means of awakening charity.</p>


<div class="p2 blockquote">
<a id="ch9_2"></a>
<p class="hanging">2 And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who
did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</p>
</div>

<p><b>2. Who did sin?</b> It was not only a Jewish
opinion that such afflictions were a divine punishment
for sin, it is the teaching of experience
that special diseases are frequently the natural
consequence of sin either in the sufferer or in his
ancestry, and the teaching of Scripture that all
disease, and even death itself, is the fruit of sin.
This truth Christ had already recognized in at
least two instances (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 2:5;
John <a href="#ch5_14">5:14</a></span>), and it is
enforced both by warnings and by historical
illustrations in the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Leviticus">Lev.</abbr> 26:16; <abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> 28:22;
<abbr title="Numbers">Numb.</abbr> 12:10; 2 Kings 5:27</span>). The Jewish error consisted
in believing that all special afflictions were
divine visitations for special sins (<span class="muchsmaller">Job 4:7; 8:6</span>), an
opinion which was not confined to the Jews (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts
28:4</span>). This error Christ here corrects. The
form of the disciples’ question has given rise to
some needless perplexity. How could they, even
in imagination, attribute a blindness from birth
to the blind man’s own sin? All such explanations
as that some among the Jews believed in
the transmigration of souls and others in a pre-existent
state, and therefore in sins committed
in a previous life, and still others in the possibility
of sin committed by the unborn babe in the
womb, a doctrine deduced by the rabbis from
such passages as <abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 25:22 and Psalm 51:5,
are inadmissible, because these refinements in
theology, even if actually entertained among the
Jewish rabbis, certainly were not accepted among
the common people, from whom Christ drew his
disciples. The question appears to be in spirit
this: What is the explanation of this man’s
blindness? his own sin? That cannot be, for he
was born blind. Is he then punished for his
parents’ sin?</p>

<p><b>4, 5. While it is day; the night cometh.</b>
The day is life; the night is death. Christ in
his human estate was subject to the law under
which all his disciples are placed. Death cut
short his human work. The day for work is
short, the night is at hand; therefore the greater
need of earnest and urgent labor. Sleep is a
parable of death (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 104:23</span>) that should perpetually
remind us that our day is short.—&#8203;<b>The

(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 29:18; 35:5; 42:7</span>). The direct reference is to
Christ’s fulfilment of these prophecies (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 4:18,

<p><b>6, 7. Spat on the ground *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and
he anointed the eyes with the clay.</b> Clay
and spittle were both believed in ancient times
to possess curative properties. Why Christ used
them here is a matter only of conjecture. Certainly
not as remedies, for one blind from birth
could not be cured by a remedy so simple, and
he who healed the blind men at Jericho by a
touch (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 20:34</span>) had no need here to resort to
other means. Not to conceal the miracle, as
may have been the case in analogous instances

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
(<span class="muchsmaller">see Mark 7:33; 8:23, notes</span>), for here his object was to
manifest the works of God, and the result was a
public and protracted investigation of his own
character. It is noticeable, however, that Christ
never cured without giving the healed something
to do, as a test of his faith and obedience.
Even in the three cases of raising from the dead
he called on the mourners, to indicate by their
obedience to his direction their faith in him
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 9:24, 25;
Luke 7:14; John <a href="#ch11_39">11:39</a>, <a href="#ch11_40">40</a></span>). When he was
asked to heal, the simple request served as an
indication of faith; when, as here, he volunteered
the cure, he seems always to have required
some act as an evidence of faith. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch5_6">5:6-8</a>.—&#8203;<b>Go, wash in the pool of Siloam.</b>
One of the pools in the vicinity of Jerusalem,
entitled also Siloah or Shiloah (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Nehemiah">Neh.</abbr> 3:15; <abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 8:6</span>).
It is identified with a pool or tank still found in the
vicinity of Jerusalem, which stands to the south
of the Temple mount, and consists of an oblong
tank, partly hewn out of the rock and partly
built of masonry, measuring about fifty-three
feet in length, eighteen feet in width, and nineteen
feet in depth, with a flight of steps leading
down to the bottom. Several columns stand out
of the side walls, extending from the top downward
into the reservoir, the design of which it is
now difficult to conjecture. The water passes
out of this reservoir through an open channel cut
in the rock, which is covered for a short distance,
and a few yards off is partly dammed up
by the people of the adjoining village of Siloam,
for the purpose of washing their clothes, and
then divided into small streams to irrigate the
gardens below. The water flows into this reservoir
from an artificial cave or basin under the
cliff. This cave is entered by a small archway
hewn in the rock. It is irregular in form, and
decreases in size as it proceeds from about fifteen
to three feet in height. It is connected
with what is known as the Fountain of the Virgin
by a remarkable conduit cut through the
very heart of the rock in a zigzag form, measuring
some seventeen hundred and fifty feet, while
the distance in a straight line is only eleven hundred
feet. This remarkable fact was discovered
by Dr. Edward Robinson, who had the hardihood
to crawl through the passage.—&#8203;<b>Which is by
interpretation Sent.</b> The meaning of this
addition has been doubted, but does not seem to
me to be doubtful. The pool, by its very name,
was a symbol of Him who was sent into the
world to work the works of God
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch9_4">4</a></span>), and who
gives light to the world by providing a fountain
in which not only all uncleanness is washed
away, but all ignorance and blindness of heart.—&#8203;<b>He
went therefore</b>, etc. Compare with the
cure of Naaman (<span class="muchsmaller">2 Kings 5:11, 13</span>), who was in like
manner bid to wash in Jordan, and only reluctantly
and after angry resistance consented.
Observe how great the trial to this blind man’s
faith, directed to take so considerable a walk, in
his blindness, as a condition of cure. Observe,
too, in the miracle a parable of redemption. The
whole world lieth in darkness from the beginning
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 107:10; <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 4:16; 1 John 5:19</span>); Christ, the
light of the world, comes to call us out of darkness
into marvellous light (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 26:18; 2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 4:6; <abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr>
1:13; 1 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 2:9</span>); the condition of receiving that
light is faith, exemplified by obedience, without
which the soul remains in darkness (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr> <a href="#ch1_5">1:5</a>;
<a href="#ch3_19">3:19</a></span>); and he often calls us to prove our faith
by walking, in obedience to his direction, in the
darkness for a while, in order that we may come
into the light (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 8:22-26, notes</span>).</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>

But the passages cited to show that John uses

<p><b>22, 23. Because they feared the Jews.</b>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
The term “Jews,” as John uses it, generally
means the Judeans, <i>i. e.</i>, the inhabitants of Judea,
as distinguished from the Galileans or other dispersed
Israelites. Living in the vicinity of Jerusalem,
they were most attached to its ritual, and
most intolerant of any departure from Jewish
ceremonials or any fellowship with the Gentiles.
Through their influence the Sanhedrim had resolved
that any one who acknowledged Jesus as
the Messiah should be excommunicated. When
this resolution was arrived at does not appear.
It clearly indicates that even in Judea there was
growing a feeling, if not a faith, that Jesus of
Nazareth was the Promised One.—&#8203;<b>He should
be put out of the synagogue.</b> That is,
excommunicated. According to the Jewish
scholars, there were three kinds of discipline
known in the ancient synagogues, all of which are
entitled <cite>excommunication</cite> or <dfn>cutting off</dfn>. Excommunication
in the slightest degree involved separation
from the synagogue, and the suspension
of intercourse with all Jews whatever, even with
one’s wife and domestics. A person who had
exposed himself to excommunication was not
allowed to approach another nearer than a distance
of four cubits. This separation was continued
for thirty days; and in case the excommunicated
person did not repent, the time might be
doubled or tripled, even when the transgression,
by means of which it was incurred, was of small
consequence. The second degree of excommunication
is denominated <dfn>the curse</dfn>, and was more
severe in its effects. It was pronounced with
imprecations, in the presence of ten men, and so
thoroughly excluded the guilty person from all
communion whatever with his countrymen, that
they were not allowed to sell him anything, even
the necessaries of life. The <em>third degree of excommunication</em>
was more severe in its consequences
than either of the preceding. It was a solemn
and absolute exclusion from all intercourse and
communion with any other individuals of the
nation; and the criminal was left in the hands,
and to the justice of God. It is probable that in
the time of Christ the second degree of excommunication
was not distinguished from the third.
It is uncertain what degree of excommunication
was here threatened; but it is quite unimportant,
since the first was sure to be succeeded
by the others, unless the condemned repented,
and made confession of his wrong-doing; in
this case retracted his confession of Jesus as the
Messiah.</p>

blind man. The conference with his parents has
been held in his absence. They then summon
him into their presence with the declaration that
they have discovered the imposture, and call on
him to confess it.—&#8203;<b>Give God the praise</b> is
not equivalent to <em>Give to God the glory of your
cure</em>; they do not admit that any cure has been
wrought. It is a solemn form of adjuration to
confess the fraud which they pretend to have
discovered (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Joshua">Josh.</abbr> 7:19</span>).—&#8203;<b>We know that this
man is a sinner</b>, indicates that their investigation
has discovered the imposture. The
man’s reply is shrewd and wise. He will not
undertake to dispute the conclusion which these
doctors of the law pretend to have reached; but
neither will he abate in the slightest his testimony
to the miraculous cure.—&#8203;<b>One thing I
know, that being blind, now I see.</b> No
testimony to Christ is more pertinent or potent
than this personal experience of his grace. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>

<p><b>26, 27.</b> Defeated in an attempt to overawe
the blind man, the Pharisees resort to the common
artifice of cross-examination; they call on
him to repeat his story, in the hope of detecting
some real or imaginary discrepancy in his two
accounts, by which they may discredit him. He
refuses to be cross-examined; grows impatient
at their manifest injustice; answers defiantly.—&#8203;<b>Ye
will not hear.</b> Equivalent to, Ye will not
heed, will not accept. It is useless to repeat
testimony which they have resolved to reject.
He thus illustrates Christ’s precept, Neither cast
ye your pearls before swine (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 7:6</span>).—&#8203;<b>Will
ye also be his disciples?</b> Ironical. The
man affects to misunderstand their object, and
to think that they are inquiring for the purpose
of becoming Christ’s disciples. The mere
suggestion elicits an indignant disclaimer, and so
brings out clearly that they are not honestly
seeking to get at the truth respecting Jesus, but
are attempting to discredit him. The word <em>also</em>
scarcely indicates, as some suppose, that the

<p><b>30, 31.</b> The argument of these verses is,
(1) founded on the Pharisees’ doctrine that man
is made acceptable to God by his good works.
The Pharisees could furnish no reply to it, because
they believed that God only heard the
prayers of the pious (<span class="muchsmaller">see
<abbr title="Nehemiah">Neh.</abbr> 13:14, 22, 31; 2 <abbr title="Samuel">Sam.</abbr>
22:21</span>). The doctrine that he hears and answers
the prayers of the penitent, though abundantly
taught in the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 25:11; 32:5; Isaiah 55:6, 7</span>),
they wholly ignored; (2) It is founded on the
Scriptural doctrine that God does not hear
the prayer of deliberate, willful and persistent
sinners, while continuing in their sins. If this
“man that is called Jesus” was the impostor
that the Pharisees declared him to be, God would
not accompany his ministry with such manifestations
of divine blessing (<span class="muchsmaller">Isaiah 1:11-15; 59:1, 2;
<abbr title="Proverbs">Prov.</abbr> 15:8, 29; 21:27; 28:9;
<abbr title="Jeremiah">Jer.</abbr> 14:11, 12; Amos 5:21-23;
Micah 3:4</span>); (3) It accords in fact with the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
doctrine of prayer, which teaches us to pray in
the name and for the sake of Jesus Christ, in
and through whom we are heard, though sinners
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_13">14:13</a>, <a href="#ch14_14">14</a>;

<a href="#ch16_24">24</a></span>). Observe the
double condition of prayer, as indicated by this
man: (1) a true reverence of God, (2) a sincere
practical obedience to his will. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch15_17">15:17</a>;

<p><b>35-38. When Jesus heard that they had
cast him out.</b> Perhaps he purposely waited,
that the man’s fidelity to the truth might be fully
tested. This trial of the blind man symbolizes
the trial to which Christ subjects his church
(<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 1:7</span>). When men cast the faithful witness
out, Christ comes to him (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 27:10</span>). Thus the
man realizes the promise of Luke 6:22.—&#8203;<b>Dost
thou believe on the Son of God.</b> There
is an emphasis on <em>Thou</em> in the original, which
cannot well be repeated in the English. Christ
contrasts his belief with the disbelief of the
Pharisees. “Believest thou, whilst so many
others are disbelievers” (<cite>Trench</cite>).—&#8203;<b>Who is he,
Sire, that I might believe on him.</b> The
word translated lord (<span lang="el">κύριος</span>) is only a general
term of respect. It is sometimes translated <dfn>Sir</dfn>
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 21:30;

<a href="#ch5_7">5:7</a>; <a href="#ch12_20">12:20</a>;
<a href="#ch20_15">20:15</a></span>).
It does not imply here that the man recognized
in Jesus the Son of God. But his language,
<cite>That I might believe on him</cite>, indicates that he
was ready to believe when the Messiah should
be made known to him. This spirit of desire
always brings the answer of disclosure (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:6;
Acts, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 10</span>).—&#8203;<b>Thou hast both seen him.</b> A
reminder of the benefit which has been conferred

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
upon the man.—&#8203;<b>And it is he that talketh
to thee.</b> To no one did Christ disclose his
divine nature more clearly than to this blind
man, whose fidelity to truth showed him worthy
to receive the disclosure of further truth, and
one which even the disciples but imperfectly
apprehended.—&#8203;<b>Sire, I believe. And he
reverenced him.</b> Not necessarily <em>worshipped</em>.
The original does not necessarily signify anything
more than a form of salutation paid by an
inferior to a superior, by falling upon the knees
and touching the forehead to the ground. For
meaning of both words, “lord” and “worshipped,”
see <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 8:2, note. It is clear, however,
that the man accepted fully Christ’s declaration
respecting himself, though not so clear
that he fully comprehended his meaning.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The cure of the man born blind.</span> It is
safe to assume that John has narrated no event
at such length as this miracle and its subsequent
investigation without a definite purpose. The
general lessons taught by this account, apart
from those incidentally conveyed in single utterances,
appear to me to be three. (1) This is the
only one of Christ’s miracles which was subjected
to a judicial or <i lang="la">quasi</i> judicial investigation.
That investigation originated not with the
disciples, but with the people, and was carried
on before a hostile tribunal. The identity of the
blind man was established by his own testimony
and corroborated by that of his parents. That
he was born blind was established by the same
indisputable evidence. That he was cured was
ocularly demonstrated. The cure necessarily
involved a miracle, since congenital blindness
is not curable by natural means. The value
of the evidence is increased by the facts that
the parents were reluctant witnesses; that the
man himself had no interest to further the cause
of Christ, since he did not even know who
he was; that the Pharisees themselves were
forced to the unconscious admission that a miracle
had been wrought (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch9_34">34</a>, note</span>); and that,
defeated in their attempt to browbeat the witness,
they endeavored to discredit his testimony
by excommunicating him. (2) There is an instructive
contrast in the characters so briefly but
graphically portrayed. (<i>a</i>) The people, moved
by mere wonder, investigate curiously but not
earnestly, reach no conclusion, and so learn
nothing of Christ; (<i>b</i>) The Pharisees, instigated
by malice and religious bigotry, investigate thoroughly,
and are compelled to adopt the conclusion
that a miracle has been wrought, but refuse
to accept the Worker as even a man sent from
God, and so learn nothing of Christ. (<i>c</i>) The
parents, honest but timid, accept the facts, but
are unwilling to risk persecution for truth’s sake,
and so learn nothing of Christ. (<i>d</i>) The man
himself, who is faithful to his convictions, and
whose convictions grow by reason of his fidelity,
is brought to a knowledge of Jesus as the Messiah,
the Son of God. Thus is illustrated the
principle that to find the truth as it is in Christ
Jesus it is not enough to investigate curiously,
earnestly, honestly; it is necessary also to confess
fearlessly the truth so far as it is apprehended.
(3) The history of the blind man illustrates
the growth of faith, as well as its conditions.
At first he knew nothing of Jesus; but
without knowledge or definite hope he obeys
Christ’s direction, goes to the pool of Siloam,
washes, sees. He still knows nothing of the
Healer but that he is “a man that is called
Jesus.” Despite the timidity of his parents, and
the threatening of the Pharisees, he maintains
the truth, defends the unknown, asserts him
to be a prophet, and a man of God. Finally,
he finds in him the Messiah, the Son of God.
Fidelity, in that which is least, is the condition
of receiving larger gifts in knowledge and faith.</p>

<a href="#ch8_15">8:15</a>; <a href="#ch12_47">12:47</a>. Christ
does not hesitate to state truths at different times
in forms which make his statements apparently
contradictory. He does not come to announce
judgment or condemnation, but to provide
mercy; nevertheless, he has come <em>for judgment</em>,
since he draws to himself all that love the divine
character and the divine life, and repels all that
are worldly and selfish. He does not condemn,
but they that reject him are self-condemned,
testifying that they love darkness rather than
light because their deeds are evil.—&#8203;<b>That they
which see not might see, and that they
which see might be made blind.</b> The
meaning is not, <em>That they which see not their own
blindness might be made to see it</em>; this interpretation
makes the second clause of the sentence
either a mere repetition of the first, <em>And that
they which think they see might be made aware that
they are blind</em>, or unmeaning. Nor is it to be rendered,
<em>That they which see not spiritual things might
be made to see them, and they which see the world
might be made blind to that as a preparation for seeing
Christ</em>; for though this would be in analogy
with Paul’s metaphor (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 6:11; 7:9</span>), it would not
interpret Christ’s declaration that he has come for

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
judgment. The two clauses of the sentence are to
be interpreted alike. Christ’s coming gave moral
and spiritual sight to the publicans who were
without moral culture, but opened their hearts
to receive Christ’s instructions; and it darkened
such moral sense as the Pharisees already possessed,
since they closed their eyes to the clear
revelation which Christ brought. Thus Christ
is both savor of life unto life and of death unto
death (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 2:16</span>), both the corner-stone and the
stone of stumbling (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 2:6-8; <abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 3:12, note</span>).</p>

<p><a id="TOC125"></a>This parable was probably uttered in Judea,
and in the immediate vicinity of Jerusalem. The
figure is drawn from the spectacle, likely at any
evening to be witnessed on the hillsides of Judea,
a flock of sheep gathered from the different fields
in which they had been wandering, and <em>following</em>
their shepherd, who conducts them to the sheepfold,
which they enter, one by one, for protection,
the shepherd going before and leading them
in. To understand aright its meaning, two facts,
often forgotten, must be borne in mind: (1) that
the metaphor is used in the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>, and for a
double purpose; sometimes the shepherd is the
religious teacher of Israel, whose unfaithfulness
is rebuked in the prophets (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Jeremiah">Jer.</abbr> 23:1-4; <abbr title="Ezekiel">Ezek.</abbr>, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 34</span>);
sometimes the shepherd is the Lord, who leads,
defends, and feeds the soul which trusts in him
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 23; Isaiah 40:11</span>); (2) the parable is closely connected
with the discourse concerning blindness,
growing out of the cure of the blind man, and is
given for the purpose of emphasizing and carrying
out the warnings therein contained against
the Pharisees as blind leaders of the blind (<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
15:14). I understand, then, that it is a parable
with a double application. First, Christ compares
the Pharisees to shepherds, himself to the
door, and declares that they alone are true shepherds
who enter into Israel through, <i>i. e.</i>, under
command from, and with the authority of,
Christ as the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Messiah—all</span> others are thieves and
robbers (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verses">vers.</abbr> <a href="#ch10_7">7-10</a></span>); he then changes the application,
retaining the figure, declares himself to be
the shepherd, whose praises David and Isaiah
sang, and indicates the nature of the service
which he will render to his sheep, namely, giving
his life for them. The parable itself embraces
verses <a href="#ch10_1">1-6</a>; the first application, a lesson against
the false Pharisaical teachers, verses <a href="#ch10_7">7-10</a>; the
second application, a lesson concerning himself
as the good shepherd, verses <a href="#ch10_11">11-18</a>. The first
application is interpreted by Ezekiel, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 34; the
second, by Psalm 23 and Isaiah 40:11. The
ordinary interpretation, which regards Christ as
referring to himself throughout as shepherd,
necessarily supposes that he employs a mixed
metaphor, in which, without any apparent reason,
he alternately represents himself as the door
and the shepherd.</p>

<p><b>1. He that entereth not by the door

constructed in the East, are low, flat buildings,
erected on the sheltered side of the valleys, and

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
when the nights are cold, the flocks are shut up
in them, but in ordinary weather they are merely
kept within the yard. During the day, of course,
they are led forth to pasture by the shepherds.
The folds are defended by a wide stone wall,
crowned by sharp thorns which the wolf will
rarely attempt to scale. The leopard and panther,
however, when pressed with hunger, will
overleap the thorny hedge, and make havoc of
the flock. In Greece, folds are sometimes built
merely of a parapet of bushes or branches, placed
at the entrance of caves, natural or made for
the purpose, in the side of hills or rocky ledges.
A porter guards the door of the larger sheepfolds.
See <cite>Thompson’s Land and Book</cite>, <abbr title="One">I</abbr>, 299,
and <cite>Smith’s Bible Dict.</cite>, <abbr title="Article">Art.</abbr> <cite>Sheepfold</cite>. The
sheepfold, in this parable, answers primarily
to Israel, the then visible and organic church of
God, but secondarily to the church of Christ
in all ages, the visible and external organization,
in which the professed disciples of Christ, his
sheep, are gathered for better protection. He
that enters not by the door, but furtively climbs
up some other way, marks himself thereby as
evil disposed.</p>

definite article is wanting. Christ does not declare
that the evidence that he is the Shepherd
consists in the fact that he entered through the
door, for he is himself the door. He declares to
the Pharisees, who reject him as their Messiah,
that there is a double test of the religious teacher:
(1) he must enter into the church by the way by
which he directs the sheep to enter. There is
not one salvation for the teacher and another for
the taught; the door is the same to all; and
(2) he must enter by the one only door, Jesus
Christ. Whoever comes in the name and with
the authority of Jesus Christ is a shepherd of
the sheep; whoever comes to preach any other
Gospel, comes to rob the sheep of their Saviour

the implication here of a truth elsewhere abundantly
taught in Scripture,
that the teacher has access to
the heart of the church only
through the influence of the
Spirit of God, who opens and
closes the heart of the hearer
(<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Thessalonians">Thess.</abbr> 1:5; 2:1</span>), and the door of

own sheep by name and
leadeth them out.</b> This
figure exactly corresponds with
the actual facts of shepherd
life in the East. “As
we eat and looked, almost
spell-bound, the silent hillsides
around us were in a moment
filled with life and
sound. The shepherds led
their flocks forth from the gates of the city.
They were in full view, and we watched them
and listened to them with no little interest.
Thousands of sheep and goats were there,
grouped in dense, confused masses. The shepherds
stood together until all came out. Then
they separated, each shepherd taking a different
path, and uttering, as he advanced, a shrill,
peculiar call. The sheep heard them. At first
the masses swayed and moved, as if shaken by
some internal convulsion; then points struck out
in the direction taken by the shepherds; these became
longer and longer, until the confused masses
were resolved into long, living streams, flowing
after their leaders. Such a sight was not new to
me, still it had lost none of its interest. It was,
perhaps, one of the most vivid illustrations which
human eyes could witness of that beautiful discourse
of our Lord recorded by John.”—(<cite>Porter.</cite>)</p>

stranger will they not follow.</b> The
stranger is not the shepherd of another flock,
but one who is a stranger and a foreigner, outside
the fold and separated from the great flock
of the Israel of God. The true Christian is
never a stranger to the disciples of Jesus Christ
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 2:19</span>).—&#8203;<b>They know not the voice of
strangers.</b> The shepherd knows his own sheep
by name, and they know his voice; but the
stranger’s voice they do not know. The figure
is all true to the life. “The shepherd calls
sharply to them from time to time to remind
them (the sheep) of his presence. They know
his voice and follow on; but if a stranger calls,
they stop short, lift up their heads in alarm, and
if it is repeated, they turn and flee, because they
know not the voice of a stranger. This is not
the fanciful costume of a parable; it is a simple
fact.”—(<cite>Thompson’s Land and Book</cite>, <abbr title="One">I</abbr>, 301.)
This personality of relation between the true
religious teacher and the taught, abundantly
illustrated by Christ’s personal love for his disciples,
and by Paul’s love for the converts gathered
under his ministry, is in strong contrast
to the distance which was maintained between
the Pharisees and the common people. It is not
then a fanciful deduction that, under ordinary
circumstances, the pastor should have a personal
acquaintance with his people, should not have
so large a charge that he cannot know his people
by name, and should ordinarily depend for his
influence upon his personal acquaintance with
them, and their personal confidence in him.</p>

<p><b>8. All whosoever came before me are
thieves and robbers.</b> This verse is declared
by Tholuck to be “one of the most difficult
sentences in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>”
If <em>before</em> (<span lang="el">πρό</span>) be taken
as an adverb of time, as is generally done, then
Christ’s declaration is that all religious teachers
who preceded him were thieves and robbers, and
this would on its face include the long line of
prophets from Moses to Malachi; or if the sentence
is modified, as some propose, by the fact
that the verb is in the present tense, <em>are</em> thieves
and robbers, so that Christ embraces only the
then living teachers, still this would include
such instructors as Gamaliel and Nicodemus, if
not John the Baptist, who belonged to that
generation. The qualification of this, by the
supposition that Christ did not include true
teachers but only the false, not only falsifies his
declaration which points out the way in which
the true may be distinguished from the false,
but reduces the sentence to a truism, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, All
false religious teachers who came before me, are
thieves and robbers, <i>i. e.</i>, teachers of falsehood,
depriving men of the truth. The other proposed
qualification, All who have come claiming to be
Messiah, are thieves, etc., not only adds an important
qualification to Christ’s declaration, but
is historically an anachronism, inasmuch as there

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
is no historical evidence that any false Messiah
preceded the time of Christ. I am inclined,
therefore, to take <em>before</em> (<span lang="el">πρό</span>) as an adverb signifying
precedence in rank or authority, as it does
in <abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 1:17, James 5:12, and 1 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 4:8, and
to understand the passage, <cite>All whosoever come
claiming precedence above me are thieves and robbers</cite>.
The verb <dfn>come</dfn> (<span lang="el">ἦλθον</span>) is in the aorist tense, and
does not necessarily indicate a coming in the past
only, but would be properly used for the enunciation
of a general principle. The prophets of
the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> claimed no such precedence above
Christ; on the contrary, they were but his
heralds; and John the Baptist distinctly disavowed
such precedence (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 3:14;
<abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr> <a href="#ch1_26">1:26</a>, <a href="#ch1_27">27</a>;
<a href="#ch3_30">3:30</a></span>). The Pharisees, on the other hand, denied
Christ’s right to teach, because he did not belong
to their schools (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch7_15">7:15</a></span>), and in their conference
with the blind man had put themselves above
Christ (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch9_16">9:16</a>, <a href="#ch9_24">24</a></span>). Where there is no general
agreement among scholars, I hesitate to offer an
interpretation which differs from all, but this
appears to me on the whole more consistent with
the context, and with the teaching of the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
elsewhere, than any other, and not inconsistent
with the original. If this be a correct interpretation,
Christ’s claim here is directly antagonistic
to those who would make an eclectic religion,
by selecting truth from all the world’s religious
teachers, including Christ among the rest. For
he declares all to be robbing the world of truth,
not imparting it, who deny him the pre-eminent
rank as a religious teacher. On the other hand,
he does not stigmatize genuine moral teachers,
such as Buddha or Socrates, as thieves and robbers,
for they had no knowledge of Christ, and
claimed no precedence above him.—&#8203;<b>But the
sheep did not hear them.</b> This has been
eminently true of all teachers in the church who
have put themselves above Christ; it is the
preachers of Christ who alone have secured the
world’s attention. This is illustrated by the
history of Paul (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 4:5</span>), Luther, Wesley, and
in our own times Spurgeon, Moody, and others.</p>

<p><b>9. I am the door; by me if any enter

door by whom the shepherd (the teacher) can
alone enter in to feed the flock, he is also the
door by which alone the sheep (the disciples)
can enter into the church and into security (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts

is expressed below (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verses">vers.</abbr>

<abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:1, 28, 31, etc.</span>)—<b>And

“go in and out” was a common Hebraistic
phrase to denote the whole life and action of
man (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr>
28:6; Psalm 121:8</span>). Here, therefore, the
meaning is that he who thus enters the door,
shall be blessed in all his ways. His pasture is
the bread of life and water of life, promised in
<abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr> <a href="#ch4_14">4:14</a>; <a href="#ch6_48">6:48-51</a>.
So that Christ is at
once the door, the shepherd, and the pasture;
the entrance, the guardian and guide, and the
food of the disciple.</p>

make the whole life, social, intellectual, moral,
and spiritual, more abundant.</p>

<p><b>11, 12.</b> With these verses Christ gives a new
direction to the preceding parable. He has thus
far spoken of religious teachers in general, and
of himself as the <em>door</em> by which they alone can
enter in to feed the flock, and by which alone
the flock can enter in to find safety. He now
speaks of himself as the Great Shepherd and
Bishop of souls (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 2:25</span>), under whom are all
the shepherds, and in contrast with whom are
the hirelings.—&#8203;<b>I am the Good Shepherd</b>,
more literally the <em>beautiful</em> Shepherd; but this
word (<span lang="el">καλός</span>), though strictly speaking esthetic,
was used by the Greeks to designate moral
beauty, and referred to the most symmetrical
and perfect goodness. Throughout the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> the
church of God is regarded as a fold, Israel as a
flock, and Jehovah himself as the Shepherd (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 23;
<abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 40:11; <abbr title="Ezekiel">Ezek.</abbr>, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 34; <abbr title="Jeremiah">Jer.</abbr>, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 23; Micah 5:3; <abbr title="Zechariah">Zech.</abbr>, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 11</span>).
It is impossible but that Christ’s auditors should
have understood him as claiming to be this
Shepherd of Israel. Observe the difference between
the phraseology here and in verse <a href="#ch10_2">2</a>; here

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
<em>the</em> good Shepherd; there <em>a</em> Shepherd.—&#8203;<b>The
good shepherd layeth down his life for
the sheep.</b> This is not a prophecy, equivalent
to, I am about to die for my sheep; it is the
enunciation of a general principle by which every
good shepherd can be distinguished from the
hireling; for every good shepherd is ready to
sacrifice his life for his sheep because they are
his; the hireling flees when danger threatens,
because he is an hireling and has no real interest
in the sheep. Neither is the expression <cite>to lay
down the life</cite> a circumlocution for <dfn>die</dfn>. Christ
rarely uses circumlocution of any kind. The
good shepherd may or may not be called on to
die for his sheep; but he always lays down his
life for them. To lay down the life is to consecrate
it, devote it to the flock; as a mother, who
is always ready to die for her children, but who,
living or dying, belongs to her children and surrenders
herself to them. So we ought also to
lay down our lives for the brethren (<span class="muchsmaller">1 John 3:16</span>),
though comparatively few are ever called on to
die for them. Wickliffe and Luther as truly laid
down their lives for the flock as Huss and Tyndale.
The sacrifice of Christ consisted not
merely in his <span style="white-space:nowrap;">death—which</span> was indeed in its
mere physical aspects the least part of <span style="white-space:nowrap;">it—but</span>
in his whole incarnation. His entire life from
his advent to the grave was laid down for his
sheep. This laying down of his life includes his
death; but it includes much more. The whole
thirty years was a living sacrifice for sinful
humanity (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr>
2:5-8</span>).—&#8203;<b>But he that is an hireling,
not being a shepherd, whose own
the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming,
and leaveth the sheep and fleeth.</b> Every
clause in this sentence must be carefully weighed
by the student; for every clause is full of
weighty significance. There is nothing in the
sentence, if the whole be considered, adverse to
a paid ministry. Not every one who is hired is
an hireling (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 5:18</span>); only he who <em>serves for
hire</em>, whether emoluments or reputation; who
accordingly is not a shepherd, <i>i. e.</i>, has none of
the shepherd’s instincts and none of the shepherd’s
love for his flock; <em>whose own the sheep are
not</em>, <i>i. e.</i>, who has none of that sense of ownership
in his flock which Paul experienced and
expressed (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 4:14, 15;
1 <abbr title="Thessalonians">Thess.</abbr> 2:11; 1 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 1:2;
Titus 1:4; Philemon 10</span>); who, therefore, <em>careth not
for the sheep</em> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch10_13">13</a></span>), but only for himself. Here,
as everywhere in Christ’s instructions, it is the
evil spirit which he condemns and the right
spirit which he exalts. The hirelings of Christ’s
day were those among the chief rulers and the
priests, the religious teachers of Israel, who believed
on Jesus, but would not confess their
faith for fear of the hierarchy (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch9_22">9:22</a>; <a href="#ch12_42">12:42</a>,
<a href="#ch12_43"></a>43;
<a href="#ch19_38">19:38</a></span>). The hirelings ever since have been
those in the church, whether paid preachers or
no, who have feared to withstand falsehood and
danger, and have suffered popular sins to pass
unrebuked lest they should bring obloquy upon
themselves, or loss of friends, or personal peril,
or any martyrdom, large or small. The hireling,
too, does not merely <em>flee</em>; the true shepherd has
sometimes to do this (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 10:23</span>); Christ himself
did this repeatedly (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 14:13; Luke 4:30; John 8:59;
10:39</span>). It is characteristic of the hireling that
he <em>leaveth the sheep</em> and fleeth. Caution may lead
the true pastor to avoid a conflict which will
bring greater disaster on the flock than battle;
but his caution is always to be exercised for the
sheep, not for himself. It is caring for one’s
self more than for the church that marks the
hireling.—&#8203;<b>The wolf catcheth them and
scattereth the sheep.</b> Any and every willful
and determined opponent to truth and righteousness
is a wolf; whether he is a persecuting
power like that of pagan and papal Rome, or a
false teacher, a wolf in sheep’s clothing (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 7:15;
Acts 20:29</span>). The wolf at this particular juncture
was the Pharisaic party, which was ravaging the
church of God, and binding heavy burdens on
the people, whom Christ denounced, and in battle
with whom he suffered death.</p>

<p><b>13-15. The hireling *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* careth not for
the sheep *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</b>—&#8203;<b>I know my sheep.</b> Christ
reiterates the contrast between the hireling and
the good shepherd; and indicates anew points
of distinction between the two. The hireling
careth not for the sheep; he cares only for his
wages; the good shepherd knows his sheep and
is known by them. In a limited way this is true
of the good pastor or shepherd; he knows his
flock personally and sympathizingly; he is not
merely a preacher to them; he is their best
friend and adviser (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch10_3">3</a>, note</span>). But this knowledge
is never perfect, and never can be, in the
under shepherd. His insight is imperfect; his
sympathy is partial. It is only Christ who can
say I <em>know</em> my sheep. “If you would think
rightly of the Son of Man, think of the Person
who knows thoroughly everything that each one
of you is feeling, and cannot utter to others or
to <span style="white-space:nowrap;">himself—every</span> temptation from riches, from
poverty, from solicitude, from society, from gifts
of intellect, from the want of them, from the
gladness of the spirit, from the barrenness and
dreariness of it, from the warmth of affection

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
and from the drying up of affection, from the
anguish of doubt and the dulness of indifference,
from the whirlwind of passion and the calm
which succeeds it, from the vile thoughts which
spring out of fleshly appetites and indulgences,
from the darker, more terrible suggestions which
are presented to the inner will. Believe that he
knows all these, that he knows <em>you</em>. And then
believe this also, that all he knows is through
intense, inmost sympathy, not with the evil that
is assaulting you, but with you who are assaulted
by it. Believe that knowledge, in this the Scriptural
sense of <span style="white-space:nowrap;">it—the</span> human as well as the divine
sense of <span style="white-space:nowrap;">it—is</span> absolutely inseparable from sympathy.”—(<cite>Maurice.</cite>)—<b>And
am known of mine.</b>
Christ’s knowledge of the Christian is the basis
of the Christian’s knowledge of Christ. Both are
sympathetic and personal, the knowledge of love.
It is because the Good Shepherd knows his sheep
that he is known of them. It is because by his
knowledge he is able to enter into our innermost
experience, and to give us comfort and strength
when all human helpers fail, that we come to
know him as our Helper and our Strength. We
know him as the Good Shepherd only as we follow
his guidance, accept the food and water he
gives us, are restored by him when wandering,
and delivered by him from danger and death.—&#8203;<b>As
the Father knoweth me, even so know
I the Father; and I lay down my life
for the sheep.</b> The connection is not very
clear between this sentence and the preceding
one, or between the different clauses of this sentence.
It seems to me, however, that Christ
refers to this knowledge between himself and the
Father, not merely to illustrate the knowledge
between himself and his disciples, but to turn
their thoughts from himself to the Father.
Christ has been accused of blasphemy by the
Jews; that is, of endeavoring to deflect the
reverence and allegiance of the people from God
to himself. It must be confessed that there has
often been a tendency in his disciples to substitute
the Saviour for the Father, to believe in
the sympathy of Christ, but not in the sympathy
of God, to believe in the love of the Redeemer,
but to attribute justice and wrath to Jehovah.
Christ guards against this tendency, and refutes
this accusation, by the declaration that he knows
perfectly every wish and will of the Father, and
in the whole course of his self-sacrifice, in all the
laying down of his life for humanity, he is carrying
out that will. Thus the declaration of this
verse leads one to that of verse <a href="#ch10_17">17</a>: “Therefore
doth my Father love me because I lay down my
life.”</p>

<p><b>16-18. Other sheep I have which are not
from</b> (<span lang="el">ἐκ</span>) <b>this fold</b>. Not, Which are in other
worlds; for the Bible does not anywhere recognize
this world as the fold of God: nor, Others
from among the dispersed Jews scattered among
the Gentiles; for these were already in “this
fold,” none the less belonging to Israel because
they were geographically separated from their
brethren. The reference is to those whom
Christ has among the Gentiles, and, as I believe,
still has among the heathen (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 10:35; 18:10</span>).
They are not, however, in a flock or fold, but
scattered (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch11_52">11:52</a></span>). Observe, Christ does not say
<cite>I am to have</cite>—&#8203;the present is not used in lieu of
the future. He already has them; they are his
sheep; he recognizes as his own those whose
spirit is akin to his, though they do not recognize
him as theirs (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 25:37-40</span>).—&#8203;<b>Them also
I must lead.</b> Not <em>bring</em>, <i>i. e.</i>, to the Jewish
nation, but <em>lead</em> as a shepherd. He must be
leader to all who will follow him, whether Jew
or Gentile.—&#8203;<b>And there shall be one flock,
one Shepherd.</b> Not one <em>fold</em>, as unfortunately
translated in our English version (<span lang="el">μία ποίμνη</span>, not
<span lang="el">μία αὐλή</span>). “Not <em>one fold</em>, but <em>one flock</em>; no one
exclusive enclosure of an outward <span style="white-space:nowrap;">church—but</span>
one flock, all knowing the one Shepherd, and
known of Him.”—(<cite>Alford.</cite>) And one flock because
one Shepherd; one not in creed, or organization,
or method of worship, but one in Christ
Jesus (<span class="muchsmaller">see
<abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 30</span>).—&#8203;<b>Therefore doth my Father
love me because I lay down my life.</b> Not
because I <em>have</em> laid it down, as though the love
of the Father were caused by the earthly love
and sacrifice of Christ, but because I <em>lay</em> it down.
That is, because Christ’s Spirit is one of self-sacrificing
love, manifested by, but not alone
embodied in the incarnation, he is loved by
the Father. See <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:9; <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 1:9.—&#8203;<b>In
order that I may take it again.</b> Beware
of understanding this, as many of the commentators
seem to do, as equivalent to, <cite>I die in order
that I may rise from the dead</cite>. The meaning is
interpreted by Christ’s declaration to his disciples:
“He that loseth his life for my sake shall
find it.” Christ lays down his life by his humiliation,
his incarnation, his passion and his crucifixion,
that he may take it again in the life of the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
myriads whom he has redeemed from death by
his own death. He takes it again when he sees
of the travail of his soul and is satisfied (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 53:11</span>),
which he does when those who have been washed
and made white in the blood of the Lamb stand
before him (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 7:14, 15</span>). So every mother, laying
down her life in continued self-sacrifice for
her children, takes it again in their developed
manhood and womanhood.—&#8203;<b>No one taketh it
from me, but I lay it down of myself.</b>
<em>No one</em> is not equivalent to <em>no man</em>, a translation
which weakens if it does not destroy the sense.
The sacrifice of Christ, the whole experience of
humiliation and suffering, commencing with the
laying aside of the glory which he had with the
Father and culminating in the crucifixion, was
not imposed upon him by any one, neither by
man, nor by Satan, nor even by the Father; it
was self-assumed. This fact is the answer to all
those objections to the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> doctrine of the
atonement, which misrepresent it as portraying
a God who inflicts on an innocent victim the
punishment which was deserved by others.—&#8203;<b>I
have power to lay it down and I have
power to take it again. This commandment
have I received of my Father.</b> The
word rendered <em>power</em> (<span lang="el">ἐξουσία</span>), includes both
<em>power</em> and <em>right</em> (<span class="muchsmaller">see <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_12">1:12</a>, note</span>); the word rendered
<em>commandment</em> (<span lang="el">ἐντολὴ</span>), is not equivalent to
authority; the original word always means <em>law</em>
or <em>command</em>. Christ’s disciples have no authority
to frame self-sacrifices for themselves; doing
this is always characteristic of a corrupt and
<i lang="la">quasi</i> pagan religion. They are to bear with
cheerful heroism whatever self-sacrifice the providence
of God may lay upon them. So also they
have never a right to seek death, but are always
to seek to <em>live</em> to the glory of God and for their
fellow-men. But Christ voluntarily chose his
life of humiliation and cross-bearing; voluntarily
sought its privations; and finally went, not to
an inevitable death, but to one which he might
easily have avoided by flight, if he had acted
according to the directions which he gave his
followers, and on which the apostle subsequently
acted. He might have fled from Jerusalem on
the fatal night of his arrest, as he had done
before, and this without leaving his sheep to be
seized or scattered by the wolf; or he might have
been protected by supernatural power (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:53</span>).
He did not because he had a peculiar authority
given to him, which his followers do not possess,
to lay down his own life, both in the self-assumed
humiliation of the incarnation, and in the final
tragedy of his death. And this peculiar authority
he possessed because in all his incarnation
and passion and death he was carrying out the
will and obeying the command of his Father.
To us the divine command is interpreted by
providence; Christ needed no such interpreter,
for he knew the Father’s will, knowing the
Father even as he was known by the Father.</p>

<p><b>22-24. The feast of the Dedication.</b> A
Jewish feast instituted by Judas Maccabeus, in

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
commemoration of the cleansing of the second
temple and altar, after they had been polluted
by Antiochus Epiphanes. The profanation took
place <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 167, the purification <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 164. The
festival commenced on the 25th day of the ninth
month, Kislev, answering to our December, and
lasted eight days. It was also called the feast of
Lights, from the fact that the Jews illuminated
their houses as long as the feast lasted. Instituted
by the Maccabean dynasty, and observed
chiefly by the more rigid Judeans, it afforded to
Christ an audience only of the more narrow-minded
and bigoted of the Jews, a fact which
must be borne in mind in studying his teaching
on this occasion.—&#8203;<b>It was winter.</b>—&#8203;The fact
is stated to explain our Lord’s walking in Solomon’s
portico. For description and illustration
of this portico, see Acts 5:12, note. This minute
detail, the exact locality where he gave this
instruction, is one of the many indications which
this Gospel affords of being written by an
eye-witness.—&#8203;<b>The Judeans therefore surrounded
him.</b> The verb (<span lang="el">κυκλόω</span>) is generally
used in a hostile sense, <i>e. g.</i>, of armies encompassing
a city (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 21:20; <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 11:30; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 20:9</span>).
This is the meaning here; an excited and threatening
crowd hedged about Jesus as he was quietly
walking in the porch. “Their fixed design was,
not to leave him at liberty till he should have
uttered the decisive word.”—(<cite>Godet.</cite>) This was
the earliest manifestation of that design which was
finally accomplished when the oath was administered
to Jesus by the High Priest, and he was
adjured to say whether he was the Son of God
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:63, note</span>).—&#8203;<b>How long dost thou keep
our souls in suspense?</b> This English idiom
almost literally answers to the Greek idiom (<span lang="el">τὴν</span>
<span lang="el">ψυκὴν αἴρεις</span>), which is still more exactly, <cite>How
long dost thou keep our souls lifted up?</cite> <i>i. e.</i>, with
expectation and uncertainty. Commingled and
contradictory feelings in the crowd were probably
represented by this question; some hoped
that Jesus was the Messiah and desired to compel
him to declare himself; others were enraged
with him, and desired to extort some utterance
which would give them the opportunity to condemn
him for blasphemy, or to excite the mob
against him.</p>

not it is true as plainly as
he had told the Samaritan woman
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch4_26">4:26</a></span>), but
more plainly than he had told his own disciples
previous to Peter’s confession of faith, “Thou
art the Christ, the Son of the living God” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
16:16</span>); and he now answers them as he answered
John the Baptist, who, in a very different spirit,
preferred the same request for a definite answer
to the question, “Art thou He that should
come?” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 11:2-6.</span>) He refers them to his
works. The evidence of Christ’s divinity is not in
his declaration about himself, nor in the declarations
made concerning him by others, but in his
life, his character, and the work which he has
done and is still doing in the world. Works (<span lang="el">ἔργα</span>)
includes his miracles but is not equivalent to
miracles. See <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_12">14:12</a>, note. The reason why
he did not answer more directly is well given by
Godet: “He could not answer ‘I am,’ for the
meaning which they attached to the word Christ
had, so to speak, nothing in common with that
in which he used it. Still less could he reply, ‘I
am not;’ for he was indeed the Christ provided
by God, and in that sense he whom they expected.”—&#8203;<b>Because
ye are not of my sheep,
as I said to you.</b> The reference is either to
the implied teaching of the parable of the Good
Shepherd, or to some specific statement not
reported by the Evangelist. The genuineness
of the words <cite>as I said to you</cite> is doubted by some,
but they are regarded as authentic by most
critics. What does he mean by <cite>ye are not of my
sheep</cite>. If we look back we shall see that the
sheep of Christ are those that hear (<i>i. e.</i>, accept
and obey) his voice, and follow him (<i>i. e.</i>, imitate
his life and example). See verses <a href="#ch10_3">3</a>,
<a href="#ch10_4">4</a>, <a href="#ch10_14">14</a>,
<a href="#ch10_16">16</a>, <a href="#ch10_27">27</a>.
The declaration, then, <cite>Ye believe not because ye
are not of my sheep</cite>, is that those who do not
spiritually recognize the beauty of Christ’s teaching,
and do not attempt to follow his incomparable
example, are not to be expected to be
convinced of his divinity by purely intellectual
arguments.—&#8203;The answer to the skeptic is generally,
You cannot believe in Christ as your personal
Saviour till you begin to recognize and to
follow his teaching and example as a prophet
and a man. The declaration is the converse of
John <a href="#ch7_17">7:17</a>. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> 2 Peter 1:5-8, where the
possession of the Christian virtues is declared to
be the efficient cause of a sound Christian knowledge.

spiritual life.</p>

it is faith in his Son, <i>i. e.</i>, the ability to appreciate
spiritual life in its highest and most perfect
manifestation, and a readiness to follow
after it, by leaving all things else to attain it, as
did Paul (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 3:13, 14</span>).—&#8203;<b>And they shall never
perish, neither shall any pluck them out
of my hand.</b> The word rendered <em>perish</em> is
literally <dfn>destroy themselves</dfn> (<span lang="el">ἀπόλωνται</span>, <em>middle

here; otherwise there would be a repetition, the
second clause of the promise only reiterating the
first clause. The word <em>man</em> is not in the original;
<em>any</em> includes all powers, human and superhuman.
I, then, understand Christ’s declaration to be
that the souls which trust in him <cite>shall never
destroy themselves, and no one shall pluck them out
of his hand</cite>; <i>i. e.</i>, he promises to protect his disciples
both against their own weaknesses and
also against the strength of assailants; from
fears without and foes within; from treachery
in the soul, and from assaults on the soul. See
1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 10:13; 15:10; <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 4:19;
<abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 1:11, etc.—&#8203;<b>My

as to the reading, but the best critics agree in
sustaining the received text.—&#8203;<b>No one is able
to pluck them out of my Father’s hand.
I and my Father are one.</b> Without entering
into any doubtful disputations respecting
the relation of the Father and the Son, a problem
which I believe transcends human knowledge,
it is evident that the connection here requires us
to understand Christ as declaring himself one
with the Father, not merely in will or desire, as
the disciple is to be one with his Lord, but also
in spiritual power. The argument is, “My sheep
shall never perish, since my Father who gave
them into my hand is greater than all, and I who
hold them, am one with him.” This argument
would be without force if the meaning was not
that Christ’s <em>power</em> is equal to that of the Father.
His will might be perfectly in harmony with the
divine will, he still could not be trusted as a
divine Saviour unless his power was commensurate
with his will. So all the best expositors,

<p><b>31-33.</b> The moral power of Christ is singularly
illustrated by the manner in which he restrains
the mob by his voice and compels them
to answer his question. That question implies
that punishment is due only to wrong actors,
and he asks them before they execute sentence,
to designate any wrong that he has done. The
question is thus analogous to that of <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch8_46">8:46,</a>
“Which of you convinceth me of sin.”—&#8203;Blasphemy
was a regularly recognized crime under
Jewish law; it consisted in any endeavor to draw
away the allegiance of the people from the one
true God, and answered to treason with us,
Jehovah being under the theocracy, the Supreme
head of the nation (<span class="muchsmaller">see <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
12:32, note</span>). The reply
of the Jews to Christ’s question plainly shows
how they regarded his declaration, “I and my
Father are one,” not as indicating mere unity in
spirit and purpose, but also in power and essential
being. This is not indeed conclusive, for the
Jews constantly misunderstood Christ; but it is
an indication of his meaning. One practical
lesson of the unity of the Godhead, of Christ and
the Spirit with the Father, is eloquently presented
by Maurice: “The unity of the Father
and the Son is the only ground of the unity between
the Shepherd and the sheep; undermine
one and you undermine both *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. Do you
think sects would last even for an hour, if there
was not in the heart of each of them a witness
for a fellowship which combinations and shibboleths
did not create, and which, thanks be to
God, they cannot destroy. The Shepherd makes
his voice to be heard through all the noise and
clatter of earthly shepherds; the sheep hear his
voice and know that it is calling them to follow
him into a common fold where all may rest and
dwell together; and when once they understand
the still deeper message which he is uttering
here, and which the old creeds are repeating to
us, ‘I and my Father are one;’ when they understand
that the unity of the church and the
unity of mankind depends on this eternal distinction
and unity in God himself, and not upon
authority or decrees of any mortal pastor, the
sects will crumble to pieces, and there will be in
very deed, one flock and one Shepherd.”</p>

<p><b>34-36. Is it not written in your law.</b>
He does not say in <em>our</em> law, nor in <em>the</em> law, but in
<em>your</em> law. Christ does not identify himself with

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
the Jews, nor regard himself as subject to the
law, though made under it, and yielding himself
to it for a season. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch7_19">7:19</a>;
<a href="#ch8_17">8:17</a>. The
reference is to Psalm 82:6. There is no passage
in the law, <i>i. e.</i>, in the Pentateuch, which corresponds
exactly to Christ’s words here, or to
those of the Psalmist; but in Exodus 22:28, the
title of “gods” is given to the judges. The
Psalm in question is believed to have been written
on the occasion of Jehosaphat’s reform of the
courts and re-establishment of the law (<span class="muchsmaller">2 Chron.,
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 19</span>), and it contrasts the unjust judges of
Israel, who had been called gods in the law,
with God the Judge of all the earth.—&#8203;<b>Unto
whom the word of God came.</b> <cite>The word
of God</cite> is not the mere saying, “I have said ye
are gods” (<cite>Meyer</cite>); it is never used in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
in so limited a sense, to signify merely a particular
phrase or utterance. It is either, The Spirit
of God, <i>i. e.</i>, God revealing himself to and
through the prophet, as in <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_1">1:1</a> (see note
there) and <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 4:12; or it is the word given to
the prophets by the Holy Spirit and by them
repeated to the nation, <i>i. e.</i>, nearly equivalent to
the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> Scripture, as in Mark 7:13; Luke 5:1,
etc.—&#8203;<b>And the Scripture cannot be broken.</b>
Literally <dfn>loosened</dfn> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:19, note</span>). This parenthetical
declaration is a very significant testimony
to the inspiration of the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>—&#8203;<b>Whom
the Father hath sanctified.</b> The original
(<span lang="el">ἁγιάζω</span>) may be rendered either made holy, in
the sense of made clean and pure in character,
or made holy in the sense of set apart to a holy
use. It is evidently in the latter sense that it is
employed here.—&#8203;<b>And sent into the world.</b>
The sanctifying of Christ preceded the sending
into the world. Evidently, therefore, the reference
is not to any act recorded in the life of
Christ, as the descent of the Holy Spirit at the
baptism, but to a consecration in the will of God
to the work of redemption, and which preceded
the Advent.—&#8203;<b>Thou blasphemest.</b> That is,
art guilty of diverting the allegiance of the people
from God to thyself.—&#8203;<b>Because I said I
am a Son of God.</b> The article is wanting
in the Greek, and ought not to be added in the
translation.</p>

<p>These verses (34-36) have been sometimes regarded
as a partial retraction, or at least a material
modification of the declaration, “I and my
Father are one;” as indicating that Jesus Christ
is a Son of God only as every obedient soul is a
child of God (<span class="muchsmaller">1 John 3:1</span>). If this passage stood
alone, such an interpretation might possibly be
given to it; but if the audience, the circumstances,
the effect, and the other utterances of
the speaker be taken into account, it cannot be
fairly so understood. This sentence is spoken to
a mob for the purpose of checking their rage.
They have understood Christ to claim divinity.
He does not in terms explicitly disavow it. On
the contrary, when his explanation is ended, they
resume their design (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch10_39">39</a></span>), and he is obliged to
flee for his life. We should not look in such an
utterance for a disclosure of the profoundest
truths respecting Christ’s character, not because
Christ would conceal or modify the truth to save
his life, but because an angry mob is not the sort
of an audience to whom he would choose to
reveal it, or indeed could reveal it, a certain receptiveness
of soul being necessary to the comprehension
of spiritual truth. The argument of
these verses seems to me to be this: He to
whom the Spirit of God comes, and who receives
it and becomes in so far an exponent and manifestation
of God, is in a sense divine; he becomes
partaker of the divine nature; a sharer of the
divine life (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr>
8:29; <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 12:10; 2 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 1:4</span>). This
is the testimony of the Scriptures which cannot
be set aside. He, then, who is not of this world
but from above (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch8_23">8:23</a></span>), and whom the Father
consecrated above and sent down into this world,
is not guilty of blasphemy in calling himself a
Son of God. In other words, Christ compares
himself with inspired men only to contrast himself
with them; he shows that, even according
to the principles of the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> Scriptures, by
which the Jews pretended to condemn him, he
was not guilty of blasphemy, even if, being but
a man, he had made himself a son and so a representative
of God, while he, at the same time,
clearly claims to be other and higher than the
<abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> prophets and judges. But for the full disclosure
of Christ’s character, we must look to
his quiet conferences with his own disciples, who
were at least willing, if not able, to understand
him.</p>

<a href="#ch7_19">7:19</a>, <a href="#ch7_25">25</a>; <a href="#ch8_37">8:37</a></span>). All that we know
of this ministry is contained in John, chapters 7,
8, 9 and 10; though it is not improbable that the
parables of the Good Samaritan and the Pharisee
and the Publican, and the incidents at the house
of Mary and Martha belong to the same era
(<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 10:25-42;

months, from some time in December to the
first of April, intervened between the retreat of
Christ from Judea and his final entry into Jerusalem
at the Passover week. I believe that this
time was devoted to his ministry in Perea, the
district beyond Jordan; a ministry of which
John here gives a hint, to which Matthew and
Mark also refer (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 19:1, 2, etc.; Mark 10:1, etc.</span>),

<p class="p2"><a id="Note_ch11"></a><span class="smcap">Preliminary Note.</span>—There is nothing in John
to indicate the time at which this miracle took
place; and there is no general agreement among
harmonists respecting it. Robinson places it immediately
at the close of Christ’s Judean ministry
and prior to his ministry in Perea; Andrews and
Ellicott place it at the close of the Perean ministry
and immediately preceding the Passion week.
The reasons for so doing are: (1) It seems the
immediate occasion both of the triumphal procession
accorded to Jesus by the spontaneous
action of the common people, and of the more
deliberate determination on the part of the ecclesiastics
of Jerusalem to put him to death. It
does not seem reasonable, therefore, to suppose
that a long period of active service in another
part of the Holy Land intervened between this
the greatest miracle wrought by Christ and
the effects which it produced, both upon the
church party and upon the common people.
(2) Immediately after this miracle, and in consequence
of the excitement produced by it, Christ
retired into the wilderness, and is said by John
to have continued there with his disciples; and

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
the implication is that he remained in this retirement
until after the Passover (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verses">vers.</abbr>
<a href="#ch11_54">54</a>, <a href="#ch11_55">55</a></span>). To suppose
that the Perean ministry, which lasted
something like three months, was interjected
into this period of retirement, which is Robinson’s
supposition, breaks into the continuity of
John’s narrative, and does violence to its order
and symmetry, without any adequate reason.
(3) Jesus was at a considerable distance from
Bethany at the time when Lazarus was taken
sick. The sisters sent unto him at once; after
receiving their message, he remained where he
was two days; but when he reached Bethany,
Lazarus had been four days dead (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="verses">vers.</abbr> <a href="#ch11_6">6</a> and <a href="#ch11_39">39</a></span>).
Presumptively, therefore, he was at least one
day’s journey from Bethany, even if we assume
that Lazarus had died before the messengers had
reached Jesus; more probably he was two days’
journey distant, for verse <a href="#ch11_11">11</a> indicates that the
death of Lazarus took place after Jesus had
received word of his sickness. Thus the narrative
of this miracle tallies with the supposition
that Christ was carrying on his ministry in the
region beyond the Jordan, rather than with the
supposition that he was anywhere in Judea; the
more so that we have no intimation in the Gospels
of any ministry in Judea except in and
about Jerusalem, of which Bethany was practically
a suburb. (4) In Luke 13:32, Christ uses
the following language: “Behold I cast out
devils and I do cures to-day and to-morrow, and
the third day I shall be perfected.” This occurs
in the Perean ministry, and the “two days” here
referred to, have been hypothetically identified
with the “two days” during which, according to
John’s narrative here, Jesus tarried where he was
after receiving the message of Lazarus’s sickness.
The coincidence between the two passages is at
least curious, though it may be nothing more
than a coincidence. These reasons make the
chronology of Andrews and Ellicott more probable
than that of Robinson. I believe, then, that
the resurrection of Lazarus took place in the latter
part of February or the early part of March
A. D. 30, and that it was followed, after the brief
retirement at Ephraim, by the triumphal march of
Christ and his disciples up to Jerusalem, and by
his Passion and his death there. See <abbr title="Tabular Harmony"><cite>Tab. Har.</cite></abbr>,

<p><b>1, 2. Now a certain one was sick named
Lazarus.</b> The only historic person of this
name mentioned in the Bible; the indications
are that he was a younger brother. From the
incident in Luke 10:38-42, we judge that Martha
was the head of the household. Simon, probably
the father, though possibly the husband of
one of the sisters, was a leper; he had probably
died or been banished by the law, because of his
leprosy (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:6</span>).
The family appear to have
been one of wealth and social distinction; this
is indicated by the facts that they owned their
house, had their tomb in their garden, and were
able to give three hundred dollars worth of ointment
as a costly token of honor to Jesus (<span class="muchsmaller">John
1<a href="#ch2_5">2:5</a></span>). I say three hundred dollars worth because
the penny, or denarius, was a day’s wages, and
therefore equivalent to our dollar. How and
where the household first became acquainted
with Jesus, we do not know. An ingenious
writer in <cite>Smith’s Bible Dictionary</cite> endeavors to
identify Lazarus with the rich young ruler who
had great possessions, and went away from
Christ sorrowful because he was bid to sell all
that he had to give to the poor (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 19:16-22</span>);
but this ingenious hypothesis has only its ingenuity
to commend it. Of Lazarus’s life after his
resurrection, nothing whatever is known; there
are traditions respecting him, and his bones
were discovered by some of the credulous relic-worshippers
of the ninth century in the island of
Cyprus; but the traditions are as little to be
trusted as the relics.—&#8203;<b>Of Bethany.</b> This village
lies on the eastern slope of the Mount of
Olives, less than two miles (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch11_18">18</a>, note</span>) southeast
of Jerusalem. See for description and illustration,
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch12_1">12:1</a>, <a href="#ch12_2">2</a>, note. Its present name is
El-Azarieh, derived from, and memorializing the
resurrection of Lazarus. Of course, the house
of Simon and of Lazarus, and the tomb of the
latter are pointed out to the traveler by the
accommodating monks, and of course, nothing
is known about either of these sites, except that
the tomb cannot possibly be the real one. It is
a deep vault partly lined with masonry, entered
upon by a long, winding, half-ruined staircase;
the masonry is comparatively modern, and the
situation of the tomb in the centre of the village
is inconsistent with the Gospel narrative; the
genuineness of the site is repudiated by Porter,
Robinson, Thompson, and defended by no
scholar.—&#8203;<b>The town of Mary and her sister
Martha.</b> It is so characterized because their
home served as a retreat to Jesus during his
ministry in Jerusalem, and it is thus distinguished
from the Bethany beyond the Jordan mentioned

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
in <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch1_28">1:28</a>,
note. There is no reason whatever
for identifying this Mary with Mary Magdalene
or with the “woman which was a sinner,” or
the anointing referred to here and described in
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch12_1">12:1-8</a>
with the anointing performed by that
unnamed woman and described in Luke 7:36-50;
see note there.—&#8203;The designation of Bethany as the
town of Mary and her sister Martha, whom John
has not before mentioned, as well as his incidental
reference in the parenthetical sentence following,
to the anointing of the Lord by Mary, are indications
that John wrote not only with a knowledge
of the other Gospels, or at least with the main
facts, incidents, and characters described in the
other Gospels, but also with the assurance that
they were familiar to most of his readers. The
fact that Mary’s name is mentioned first, would,
taken by itself, imply that she was the elder
sister, and the head of the household; but the
fact that Martha took the responsibility of providing
for the guests in the two instances recorded
in Luke 10:38-42 and John <a href="#ch12_1">12:1-8</a>, indicates
that Martha was the elder sister and the
housekeeper.</p>

to come; they do not present any petition; they
simply report their trouble to him.—&#8203;<b>He said,
This sickness is not unto death.</b> That is,
has not death for its object; (<span lang="el">πρὸς</span> with the
accusative, marks strictly the object towards
which anything is directed.) Christ does not
say that Lazarus will not die, but that death is
not the end for which this sickness is ordained of
God.—&#8203;<b>But for the glory of God, that the
Son of God might be glorified thereby.</b>
<abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch9_3">9:3</a>, note. He was glorified, (1) perhaps
by the development of a higher spiritual
life in Lazarus through his sickness, death and
resurrection (<cite>Trench</cite>), though of this the Evangelist
gives us no hint; (2) by the manifestation
of the divine power of Jesus Christ, as one whom
the Father always hears (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch11_42">42</a></span>); (3) by the Passion
and death of Jesus Christ, to which the
resurrection of Lazarus directly led (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verses">vers.</abbr>
<a href="#ch11_47">47-53</a></span>).
This saying of Christ seems to have been uttered
not merely to his disciples; it was apparently his
message to the sisters, and to it he refers in
verse <a href="#ch11_40">40</a> (see note there).</p>

<p><b>5-7. Now Jesus loved Martha</b>, etc. This
statement is made in explanation of verse 6, that
the reader may not fall into the error of supposing
that Christ’s delay was due to any indifference
or unconcern on his part.—&#8203;<b>He abode
two days in the same place where he
was.</b> Why? Either because this delay was
necessary to complete the work in which he was
engaged, and from which he would not suffer
himself to be drawn away even by considerations
of personal sympathy, he himself acting on the
principle “Let the dead bury their dead, but go
thou and preach the kingdom of God” (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 9:60</span>);
or because this delay was necessary to the consummation
of the miracle of the resurrection of
Lazarus in such form as to forever prohibit the
impression that death had not really taken place.
The former is the better hypothesis, since in no
case does Christ seem to have wrought a miracle
for the mere purpose of producing by it a profound
impression, and it is therefore hardly consistent
to believe that he would have delayed
merely for the purpose of making the miracle
more startling and marvelous.—&#8203;<b>Let us go into
Judea again.</b> This plainly implies that Jesus
and his disciples were not then in Judea, and
thus incidentally confirms the supposition (see
<a href="#Note_ch11"><abbr title="Preliminary">Prel.</abbr> Note</a>) that the resurrection of Lazarus was
subsequent to the close of the ministry in Perea,
and that he was summoned from Perea.</p>

<p><b>8-10. The disciples say to him, Master,
the Judeans were just now seeking to
stone thee.</b> On the chronological hypothesis
adopted above, the mob in Jerusalem had threatened
the life of Jesus about three months previous.
But he had not been in Judea since. The
disciples attributed Christ’s remaining in Perea to
the fear of the Jews, and remonstrated against
his again braving them.—&#8203;<b>Jesus answered,
Are there not twelve hours in the day</b>,
etc. In interpreting Christ’s enigmatical saying
here, the student must remember that it was his
habit to speak in parables, and that he rarely
gave any interpretation of them. This is to be
regarded as a condensed and uninterpreted parable.
John has himself given us the key to its
interpretation by his use of the same metaphor
in his Epistle (<span class="muchsmaller">1 John 1:5-7</span>). God is the light. As
he has appointed the hours of activity for the
human race, the twelve hours of the day, so he

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
has appointed the hours of service for each individual
man. What was true of Christ is true of
every one; he cannot die until his time has
come (<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch7_6">7:6</a>,
<a href="#ch7_8">8</a>, <a href="#ch7_30">30</a>;
<a href="#ch8_20">8:20</a></span>). He therefore who
walks with God in the path of duty, fulfilling
the divine will, cannot stumble; no harm can
come to him; not a hair of his head can be injured
(<span class="muchsmaller">Psalm 91; <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 10:29-31; Luke 10:19; 21:18</span>). He
may and must come to his death; but not until
his twelve hours have passed away.—&#8203;But if a
man work in darkness, <i>i. e.</i>, not with God, not
in the path of duty, not endeavoring to fulfil the
divine will, for him there is no assurance of protection;
he is always liable to stumble and fall.
This is the general principle which Christ parabolically
asserts; its immediate application here
is that to Christ there is no danger in going into
Judea, for he will not die until his appointed time
has fully come. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>

interval is indicated as having taken place between
the previous discourse and the present
declaration, by the words, <cite>after that he saith unto

by the disciples as well as by their Lord. This
language, coupled with that of verse <a href="#ch11_3">3</a>, indicates
that he possessed a peculiarly lovable character.
<dfn>Sleep</dfn> is used both in the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> and <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> as a
metaphor of death (<span class="muchsmaller">2 Chron. 14:1; <abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 13:3; <abbr title="Jeremiah">Jer.</abbr> 51:57;
Job 14:12; <abbr title="Daniel">Dan.</abbr> 12:2; <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 27:52; Acts 7:60; 13:36; 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr>
7:39; 11:30; 15:6, 18, 20, 51; 1 <abbr title="Thessalonians">Thess.</abbr> 4:13, 14, 15</span>). Some
of the rationalistic critics think that the disciples
were extraordinarily stupid, not to understand
Christ’s metaphor; and yet they are guilty of a
similar but greater stupidity. Thus, the author
of <cite>Supernatural Religion</cite> says (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Volume Two">Vol. II</abbr>, 460</span>): “The
disciples reply with the stupidity with which the
fourth Evangelist endows all those who hold
colloquy with Jesus: (Lord, if he has fallen asleep
he will recover;)” and yet, on the immediately
preceding page, he interprets Christ’s similar
declaration respecting the daughter of Jairus
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 9:24</span>): “The maid is not dead but sleepeth,”
as “an express declaration” that the case is
“one of mere suspension of consciousness.”
The misapprehension of the apostles here was
not extraordinary; certainly not more so than
that afforded by some analogous instances in the
first three Gospels (<span class="muchsmaller">see <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 16:7; Luke 22:38</span>). They
had understood from verse <a href="#ch11_4">4</a>, that Lazarus was
to be restored; they had interpreted Christ’s
words as a promise of healing; they had witnessed
cases of miraculous healing in at least
two instances, wrought by a word on an absent
patient (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 7:10; John 4:50-53</span>); so when Jesus said,
“Lazarus is sleeping,” they thought the crisis
of the disease had passed, and that there was
no reason why their Master should brave the
dangers of a Judean mob to go to the bedside of
a convalescent friend.</p>

plainly</b> (<span lang="el">παῤῥησίᾳ</span>). That is, dropping all metaphor.—&#8203;<b>And
I am glad for your sakes that
I was not there.</b> He accompanies the declaration
of the friend’s death with words of consolation
and inspiration. Plain as those words are
to us, they must have been inexplicable to the
disciples. They did not forecast the resurrection;
how could they understand why Christ
should not have been present to prevent so great
a sorrow. The sympathy of Christ with us in
our sorrow does not prevent him, who sees the
end from the beginning, from rejoicing even when
he sees our tears. He sees the sheaves brought
home with joy even while the seed is sown in
tears, and rejoices at the tears because of the harvest.
To him, faith wrought in the soul is worth
immeasurably more than all the sorrow which
soul-culture involves (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 5:1-5; 8:18</span>).—&#8203;<b>Then
said Thomas which is called Didymus</b>,
that is, the twin.—&#8203;<b>Let us also go that we
may die with him.</b> With Christ, not with
Lazarus. The little that we know about Thomas
shows him to have been a man of strong passions
and of little faith and hope; to such a man life
is full of pathos. He could not believe that
Christ could with safety go into Judea again;
in this, indeed, he really forecast the result,
which was the crucifixion of his Lord; but
neither could he bear to be separated from him.
Chrysostom notes the power of Christ on this
timid nature: “The very man who dared not to
go in company with Christ to Bethany, afterwards
traveled with him through the inhabited
world, and dwelt in the midst of nations that
were full of murderers desirous to kill him.” On

respecting these four days; they are given in

however, we do not know definitely where Christ
was, except that it was some point apparently
beyond Jordan, and we do not know at all what
engagements and duties detained him there,
surmises as to the way in which these four
days were taken up are decidedly unprofitable.
The narrative seems to me clearly to imply that
Lazarus was not dead when the messengers first
reached Jesus. Probably of these four days,
two were occupied by Christ in completing his
ministry where he was when he received the
message, and two, or part of two days, in a
leisurely journey to the home of Lazarus.—&#8203;<b>Bethany
was nigh unto Jerusalem.</b> The
use of the past tense <em>was</em>, not <em>is</em>, indicates that
Bethany had ceased to exist at the time when
John wrote his Gospel; it thus incidentally confirms
the opinion that he wrote a considerable
time after the destruction of Jerusalem, and
when that city and its environs were lying waste.—&#8203;<b>About
fifteen furlongs off.</b> Literally,

those who were prejudiced against, if not
absolutely hostile to Jesus. The fact that most
of those who were present at the scene about
to be described were these Judeans, is an important
one, and must be borne in mind by the
student, for it gives a peculiar color and significance
to the entire narrative.—&#8203;<b>To comfort
them concerning their brother.</b> The Jewish
mourning rites were most carefully defined
by the Rabbinical law; they included rending the
clothes, dressing in sackcloth, sprinkling of ashes
or dust on the person, fasting, loud lamenting.
Professional mourners were employed to increase
the noisy demonstrations of grief (<span class="muchsmaller">see Mark
5:38, note</span>). The days of mourning were thirty,
which were divided into three for weeping,
seven for lamentation, and twenty for less demonstrative
mourning. During the first three days
the mourners were forbidden to wear their phylacteries
or to engage in any servile work, or to
bathe or anoint themselves; during the seven
days they fasted or ate nothing but an occasional
egg or some lentiles. After the funeral services
were over (for account of which see Luke 7:12,
note), friends and professional mourners came
and sat with the afflicted ones upon the ground,
no one speaking until the bereaved ones had
done so, but every sentence of theirs was followed
by some word of sympathy and comfort
or by the wail of the mourners. Everything
was done according to a prearranged system;
in Phariseeism there was no liberty, even in the
hour of grief.</p>

<p><b>20-22. Then Martha *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* went and
met him.</b> Jesus did not enter into the village,
but stopped without and sent some one to let
the sisters know that he had come. Geikie supposes
that he thus remained without from fear
of the Jews; but Christ never stopped in the
performance of a duty from considerations of
fear; his reply to the remonstrances of his disciples
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verses">vers.</abbr>
<a href="#ch11_8">8-10</a></span>) should have prevented this prosaic
interpretation of Christ’s action. To him
the conventional mourning customs of Oriental
society were exceedingly distasteful. He who
put all the noisy mourners out of the room in
which the daughter of Jairus lay dead (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 5:40</span>),
and who so gently rebuked the noisy and ostentatious
lamentations of the women of Jerusalem
at the time of his own crucifixion (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 23:27-31</span>),
might naturally be expected to decline to enter
into the circle of formal mourners, with the
alternative of either violating the precedents and
rules of good society, or of submitting himself
in such an hour to the bondage which they
imposed.—&#8203;<b>But Mary sat still in the house.</b>
It would appear from verse <a href="#ch11_29">29</a>, that she did not
know that Jesus had come; yet the contrast
between the two sisters, the one of whom with
bustling activity waited upon her Lord, the
other of whom, in the quieter offices of love, sat
at his feet to listen to his words, or anoint those
feet with precious ointment (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 10:38-42; John
12:1-8</span>), reappears here. Martha, who was probably
the head of the household, was naturally the
first to hear of Christ’s coming, and even in her
grief found comfort in activity; to Mary, in the
solitude of her sorrow, no one at first reported
Christ’s approach.—&#8203;<b>Lord, if thou hadst been
here, my brother had not died.</b> This is the
language both of reproach and of lamentation,
though the reproach is implied rather than
asserted. Her language expresses the very

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
essence of soul torture at such times. We are
slow to believe that our sorrow is “for the glory
of God that the Son of God may be glorified
thereby,” and in our affliction continually echo
Martha’s “if,” saying to ourselves, if we had
not done this, or if we had not done that, if
it had not been for our blunder or that of our
friends or our physician, our beloved would not
have died. Chance is the God of Atheism, and
is a comfortless God in the time of our trouble.—&#8203;<b>But
I know that even now whatsoever
thou shouldst ask of God, God will give
it thee.</b> This is interpreted by Meyer and
Godet as an expression of Martha’s faith that
Jesus is able to raise even the dead to life again;
but in order to sustain this interpretation, they
are obliged to depart from a natural and simple
interpretation of Christ’s declaration in <abbr title="verses">vers.</abbr>
<a href="#ch11_25">25</a>, <a href="#ch11_26">26</a>,
to suppose that Martha desired or was anticipating
her brother’s resurrection, and yet was so
obtuse as to entirely miss the meaning of Christ
in that declaration, and, finally, to suppose that
the faith which she possessed when she first
beheld Christ disappeared when she reached the
tomb, where she remonstrated against opening it
that the resurrection might be accomplished.
I understand Martha’s utterance here to be that
simply of an undefined hope. She had counted
so much on Christ; he had not come in the hour
of her need; all was over now; and yet now that
he had come, although too late, she went out to
him with a vague, restless hope of some succor
or consolation, she knew not what. In our own
experience in the unreasonableness of grief, like
vague and delusive hopes are not uncommon.
Calvin’s interpretation of Martha’s experience
better accords both with what we elsewhere
know of her character and with the narrative
here, than does that of those who eulogize her
extraordinary faith: “When she assures herself
that her brother would not have died if Christ
had been present, what ground has she for
this confidence? certainly it did not arise from
any promise from Christ. The only conclusion,
therefore, is that she inconsiderately yields to
her own wishes, instead of subjecting herself to
Christ. When she ascribes to Christ power and
supreme goodness, this proceeds from faith; but
when she persuades herself of more than she
had heard Christ declare, that has nothing to do
with faith. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Martha’s faith, mixed up and
interwoven with ill-regulated desires, and even
not wholly free from superstition, could not
shine with full brightness; so that we perceive
but a few sparks of it in these words.”</p>

<p><b>23-24. Thy brother shall rise again.</b>
Evidently these words were not understood by
Martha to contain a promise of immediate resurrection,
and therefore we are not justified in
saying that they were so intended by Jesus.
They are vague, and are intended to be vague
and suggestive, in order to lead on the mind of
Martha, and to evoke an expression of her faith.
This method of calling out the experience of his
pupil was a customary one with Jesus in all his
instruction.—&#8203;<b>I know that he shall rise
again in the resurrection at the last day.</b>
This statement of Martha’s faith is to be interpreted
by the belief of the orthodox Jews. This
was that all the dead departed to Hades or the
Under-world, where they dwelt in a shadowy
prison-house; the righteous in Paradise; the
wicked in Hell; and awaited the coming of the
Messiah, who would call all the righteous from
the Under-world, while the wicked would be
thrust back into it again. Martha believed that
her brother had gone to this abode of the dead,
and there was awaiting a day of judgment and
of resurrection; but she found in this faith very
little consolation. Her brother, to her thought,
was as if he were not, and dwelt among the dead.
A vague hope of a far-distant revival did not
comfort her. It is in contrast to, and in correction

<p><b>25, 26. I am the resurrection and the
life. He that believeth in me even if he
could die</b> (<span lang="el">κἄν ἀποθάνῃ</span>) <b>yet he should live,
and every one that liveth and believeth
in me never can die.</b> The various and conflicting
interpretations afforded by the commentators
of this declaration of Christ agree only in
being complicated and abstruse. It is essential
to comfort that it should be simple truth
simply expressed; and that Christ should offer
as a consolation to Martha a truth so subtle and
involved in so much mystery that skillful scholarship
can scarce unlock its meaning, seems to me
utterly incredible. I understand these words as
an embodiment of Christ’s creed respecting life
and immortality. Jesus is the source of the
resurrection, and the fountain of life. Whoever,
therefore, by faith in Christ, has Christ in him
the hope of glory, never knows death; to him
there is no Hades, no dark and dismal abode of
the dead, no long and weary waiting for a final

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
great jail delivery—a judgment and an acquittal.
He passes at once from the lower to the higher
state; he has already come to the general assembly
and church of the first-born (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 12:22-24</span>).
What we call death summons him simply to
depart and be straightway with Christ (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 1:23;
Luke 23:43</span>). The eternal life which Christ here
and now gives to those who are by faith united
to him (<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch5_24">5:24</a></span>),
is never suspended. So immortal
and potent is this life principle which Christ
offers to those who have received him, that, if it
were possible that one having died should receive
it, he would by it be made to live again. Against
the conception, common now as then, of death
as a long sleep or a long and dreary waiting for
a final resurrection, is Christ’s teaching here that
“There is no death; what seems so is transition.”
In confirmation of this view, observe, (1) That
Christ’s declaration is present, not future: “<cite>I
am the resurrection</cite>,” not, <em>I shall by-and-by become
so</em>. (2) The conditional clause <em>though he were
dead</em>, is literally <em>even though he should die</em>, and is
fairly rendered by the phrase adopted above,
<em>even if he could die</em>. (3) Thus interpreted, Christ’s
declaration is responsive to Martha’s confession
of faith, and leads on to and agrees with the
event which follows, the restoration of Lazarus
to his earthly life. (4) It accords with the
general teaching of the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>, in which Christ is
represented as the source of eternal life, and the
death of the saints as a doorway into his immediate
presence (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 7:59; <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 14:8; 2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 5:8; 1 <abbr title="Thessalonians">Thess.</abbr>
5:10; 2 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 4:8; 2 Peter 1:11, etc.</span>). It is not necessary
to give here other interpretations, for they are
complicated, incongruous, and almost impossible
to classify. They are the results of various and
unsuccessful endeavors to bring Christ’s declaration
into accord with the Pharisaic faith, which
still lingers in the Christian church, of a resurrection
and an eternal life postponed to the
future, and an abode in death, meanwhile, in
some sort of an intermediate state.</p>

<p><b>31, 32. She goeth unto the grave to

women often to visit the graves of their dead,
especially during the first days of mourning.
These too obtrusive mourners could not comprehend
that Mary might desire solitude in her
sorrow. They would not allow her to retreat
from them. Thus the private interview which
Jesus desired with the two sisters was denied
him. Consequently there was no real conference
between Jesus and Mary; as soon as she came
he asked to be shown the grave.—&#8203;<b>She fell
down at his feet.</b> With a more passionate
nature than that of Martha, her action and her
attitude were both more strongly indicative of
her uncontrollable emotion. Possibly she threw
herself prostrate at his feet in the form of salutation
ordinarily paid by an inferior to a superior
in the East; yet, with her face upon the ground,
she could hardly have carried on any conference
whatever. More probably, therefore, she flung
herself at first at his feet, then partially raised

<p><b>33-35. When Jesus therefore saw her
lamenting and the Judeans also lamenting
which came with her.</b> The word translated
in the English version <dfn>weeping</dfn>, but which
I have rendered <dfn>lamenting</dfn>, is not the same as
that employed in the declaration of verse 35,
“Jesus wept.” It implies not only the shedding
of tears but also every external expression of
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">grief—the</span> loud outcries, the rending of garments,
and the whole vociferous and ostentatious manifestation
of mourning.—&#8203;<b>He groaned in the
spirit and was troubled.</b> There seems to
be no doubt that the Greek word rendered
<dfn>groaned</dfn>, necessarily involves in it the idea of
anger or indignation; it is so rendered in the
Vulgate and in Luther’s translation. “The
words <dfn>brimaomi</dfn> (<span lang="el">βριμάομαι</span>) and <dfn>embrimaomi</dfn>
(<span lang="el">εμβριμάομαι</span>) are never used otherwise than of
hot anger in the classics; the Septuagint and
<abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 9:30;
Mark 1:43; 14:5</span>), except where
they denote snorting or growling proper.”—(<cite>Meyer.</cite>)
With this agree both the lexicons and
the critics generally. What was the cause of
this indignation? According to some of the older
commentaries, Christ was indignant with himself
for his weakness in yielding to his emotions; his
divinity was irritated at the emotion of his
humanity, and violently repressed it. This opinion
needs no refutation with those who believe
that Christianity tends to intensify, not to suppress
the natural <span style="white-space:nowrap;">affections—that</span> Christian sympathy
weeps with those that weep as well as
rejoices with those that rejoice; and who find in

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
the tears of Christ at the grave of Lazarus, not a
manifestation of human weakness, but an expression
of divine sympathy which draws God very
near to every sorrowing heart. Others suppose
that Christ saw in this scene a type of the woe
that sin has wrought in the world; seeing
its effects his indignation was aroused. Thus
Trench: “He beheld death in all its dread significance,
as the wages of sin; the needs of the
whole world, of which this was but a little
example, rose up before his eyes; all its mourners
and all its graves were present to him.”
We may certainly believe that this profound
sense of the significance of this scene of sorrow
affected Christ and intensified his sympathy;
that the tears that he shed were tears of sympathy,
not only with Mary and Martha, but also
with all sorrowing households. This, however,
interprets rather his sorrow than his indignation.
A simple and natural interpretation of this indignation
is afforded by a consideration of the circumstances
and surroundings. He was indignant
at the display of the affected grief of those who
were bitter enemies of the truth, and who would,
as he well knew, make use of this very miracle
to promote his death, and would even join with
those who would seek to put Lazarus himself
to death again (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch12_10">12:10</a></span>). He was indignant
<em>when he saw the Jews also lamenting</em>, and again
when he heard the sneer uttered by them (<span class="muchsmaller">see
<abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch11_37">37</a>,
note</span>). To this effect is Meyer: “He was
angered, then, at the <em>Judeans</em>, when he saw them
lamenting with the deep-feeling Mary, and professing
by their cries (of condolence) to share
her feelings, whilst at the same time aware that
they were full of bitter hostility to him who was
the beloved friend both of those who mourned
and of him whom they mourned.”—<b>And was
troubled.</b> Literally, <dfn>he troubled himself</dfn>. The
words “indicate a physical emotion, a bodily
trembling, which might be perceived by the
witnesses of this scene.”—(<cite>Godet.</cite>)—&#8203;<b>Lord, come
and see.</b> They did not anticipate his purpose;
they simply invited him to come to the grave, as
would be natural in such circumstances.—&#8203;<b>Jesus
wept.</b> The Greek (<span lang="el">δακρύω</span>) signifies simply
shedding of tears, weeping silently. This silent
dropping of the tears from his eyes is in contrast
with the weeping over Jerusalem (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 19:41</span>,
<span lang="el">κλαίω</span>). That was a public lamentation of a
prophet; this was the expression of the personal
sympathy of a friend. Beware of that false
philosophy which represents Christ as weeping
only as a man. In this, as in every utterance of
his nature, he was God manifest in the flesh.
By his tears at the grave of Lazarus he interprets
to us the divine sympathy which shares all our
sorrows, however much the great Sympathizer,
with his clear view of final results, may, like
Christ, be glad of the brief experience of grief
that is soon to produce so much joy
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch11_15">15</a></span>).</p>

expressed their sense of the Rabbi’s love for
his friend; others replied with a sneer. This is
indicated in the original by the Greek particle

<p><b>39, 40. Martha *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* saith unto him,
Lord, already he stinketh.</b> This is taken
by Alford as the statement of the plain fact, and
he apparently believes that it was made sensible
by the ill odor which proceeded from the cave.
Trench objects that this supposition gives to the
miracle almost “a monstrous character.” The
text seems to me to determine the question.
Martha asserts the decomposition of the body,
not as a <em>fact known</em>, but as a <em>conclusion deduced</em>
from the length of time that had passed since
the death. With her it clearly was an <span style="white-space:nowrap;">opinion—whether</span>
correct or not is purely a matter of surmise.
Apparently the body had not been embalmed;
no explanation is offered of this singular
fact. In the East it was usual to embalm the
corpse at once.—&#8203;<b>For he hath been four days</b>
(dead). We may supply either the word <em>dead</em>, as
the translators have done, or the word <em>buried</em>;
it will make little difference, for burial in the
warm climate of the East usually took place on
the day of the death. It was a Jewish notion
that for three days the spirit wandered about the
sepulchre hoping that it might return unto the
body; but on the fourth day it abandoned this
expectation and left the body to itself. Thus
Martha’s expression involves the idea that all
hope of resuscitation was past, and negatives the
interpretation of Meyer that her language in
verse <a href="#ch11_22">22</a> implies her hope of a present resurrection.—&#8203;<b>Said
I not unto thee.</b> The reference
is probably to the message sent to the sisters as
reported in verse <a href="#ch11_4">4</a>.—&#8203;<b>If thou wouldst believe,
thou shouldst see the glory of God.</b>
The faith of the sisters was to be displayed, not
in any definite expectation of the work which
their Lord was about to accomplish, but in obedience
to his directions; and in fact Martha
tacitly withdraws her remonstrance, and the
stone is rolled away from the grave. The performance
of the miracle was itself dependent on
the fulfillment of the condition, If thou wouldst
believe. The New Testament throughout treats
faith as the power of moral and spiritual discernment,
and therefore the fundamental condition
of receiving the divine blessing. “To unbelieving
Martha, Jesus could no more have restored
the dead brother, than to the unbelieving
Jairus his child (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 8:50</span>), or to the widow of
Nain her son, if her attitude toward his compassion
and his injunction ‘Weep not’ (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke
7:13</span>), had been one of unbelief.”—(<cite>Meyer.</cite>) Observe
the order in which Christ put seeing and
believing. Men are always desirous to see in
order to believe. Martha is called upon to give
an example of the contrary course: to believe
that she may see.</p>

are wanting in the best manuscripts.—&#8203;<b>And

not because God is in heaven more truly than
upon earth (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 139:7-12</span>), but because the visible
heaven is ever suggestive to the human mind of
the invisible God; and Jesus thus quickened his
own faith in the Father, as we may well do. He
prayed toward the heavens as the devout Jew
prayed toward the temple (<span class="muchsmaller">1 Kings 8:30; <abbr title="Daniel">Dan.</abbr> 6:10</span>).—&#8203;<b>Father,
I thank thee that thou hast
heard me.</b> It is not necessary to suppose, as
Alford does, a reference to some previously
uttered prayer, in Perea, for example, when the
message respecting Lazarus’s sickness was
brought to Jesus. The language is that of the
assurance of <span style="white-space:nowrap;">faith—faith</span> in a God who hears the
desire before it is expressed in prayer, who
teaches the believing soul how and for what to
pray, and who thus continually answers our
prayers by anticipation. Christ regards his
prayer as answered before it is presented.—&#8203;<b>And
I knew that thou hearest me always.</b>
Alike when the prayer is granted and when it is
denied; at the grave of Lazarus and in the agony
in Gethsemane. God hears us when his providence
says No to our petition none the less than
when it says Yes. The true Christian’s faith,
like Christ’s faith, rests not on the answer but on
the direct personal consciousness of spiritual
communion with God.—&#8203;<b>But because of the
people which stand by I said it.</b> Thus
Christ on occasion violates the letter of his own

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
rule which prohibits men to pray “that they
may be seen of men” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 6:5, 6</span>), just as in
Gethsemane he seemed to violate the letter of
his rule against repetitions in prayer (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
6:7 with <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:44</span>). Here his prayer was public
in order that men might know that he did pray,
and that his resurrection power was not his
own but was given to him by his Father, and
thus might glorify not him, but the Father in
him.—&#8203;<b>That they may have faith that thou
hast sent me.</b> Not merely that they might
believe intellectually that he was a messenger or
representative sent by the Father, but that their
thoughts might be turned from him, who was
but the instrument, the voice of God, to the
invisible Father himself, who spoke in him and
wrought through him. This prayer of thanksgiving
is in instructive contrast with the prayer
of Elijah when he raised the dead (<span class="muchsmaller">1 Kings 17:20, 21</span>).
There was the earnestness of an anxious faith;
here is the assurance of a restful faith; there
the importunity of request intensified by a fear
of denial; here the calmness of thanksgiving
already assured of a favorable response. The
simple grandeur of this prayer has not prevented
it from being criticised as artificial (Supernatural
Religion), “a show prayer” (<cite>Weisse</cite>), “a sham
prayer” (<cite>Baur</cite>). If prayer were only petition
there would be ground for this criticism; but if
prayer is the frank and free communion of the
soul with its Father, there is none. It will seem
artificial only to those who are unable to comprehend
the filial relation between a Son and his
heavenly Father.</p>

<p><b>43, 44. He cried with a loud voice.</b>
The previous prayer had been spoken in a subdued
voice; apparently, this is implied by the
suggested contrast, was only heard in Christ’s
immediate vicinity. The others knew that he
was praying, and thus recognized the miracle as
a result of his appeal to his Father; but they did
not hear the words of the prayer. The “loud
voice” was a type, a suggestion of that voice
like the sound of many waters (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 1:15</span>), at which
all who are in their graves shall come forth
(<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch5_28">5:28</a>; 1 <abbr title="Thessalonians">Thess.</abbr> 4:16</span>).—&#8203;<b>Lazarus, come forth.</b>
Literally <dfn>Here! out!</dfn> “The simplicity of these
two words, are in glorious contrast with their
efficacy.”—(<cite>Godet.</cite>)—&#8203;<b>And he that had been
dead came forth, bound hand and foot
with grave-clothes.</b> Literally <dfn>swathing-bands</dfn>
(<span lang="el">χειρία</span>). The supposition of Chrysostom, Lightfoot
and others that this coming forth <em>bound</em>
necessitated a new miracle is entirely unnecessary.
It was the Jewish custom to wrap the
dead comparatively loosely in a winding sheet
or shroud, which would have impeded though
not prevented arising and walking. The exact
nature of the swathing-bands does not appear
to be known. The word occurs nowhere else in
the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> There is, however, no reason to suppose
that the limbs were so tightly bound that
motion would be impossible. The same word is
used in classic literature to signify a flounce
worn about the bottom of the dress of the living.
The accompanying cut, which in its representation
of the tomb and grave-clothes, is produced
from a careful study of the best archæological
authorities, illustrates the probable appearance of
Lazarus better than descriptive words could do.
—<b>His
face was bound about with a napkin.</b>
A handkerchief; probably, as sometimes with us,
to prevent the falling of the lower jaw.—&#8203;<b>Loose
him and let him go.</b> Christ gives them something
to do. This is partly to recall them from
their speechless and dazed astonishment, partly
to prevent the too great and dangerous revulsion
of feeling, partly because he has done his work
and would bid them to do what in them lies to
be sharers with him in the restoration of the loved
one to life and liberty. In this is a moral significance;
we cannot raise the spiritually dead;
but we can bring Christ to their grave by our
prayers, and we can aid in their perfect liberation
when the divine voice has called them from their
sleep of death.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><a id="SuppNote_ch11"></a><span class="smcap">Note on the Resurrection of Lazarus.</span>—&#8203;This
miracle is recorded only by John. Why?
It was not only the climax of all Christ’s wonderful
works, but it also led directly on the one
hand to the triumphal procession into Jerusalem,
which is recorded by all, and on the other
to the final plans for Christ’s arrest and crucifixion.
Several explanations have been suggested
for the silence of the synoptists: (1) That
the miracle aroused hostility to Lazarus and his
sisters, and involved them in danger
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch12_10">12:10</a></span>),
and that therefore all mention of it was omitted
(<cite>Godet</cite>, <cite>Olshausen</cite>). But this hostility could
hardly have continued to threaten any real danger
to Lazarus for twenty-five or thirty years; and if
it did, we can hardly think that he or his sisters
would have shrunk from being designated as
living witnesses to the resurrection power of
their Lord. They would rather have gloried in
being permitted to suffer for him. (2) That the
narration of the resurrection would have made
the household “the focus of an intense and

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
irreverent curiosity” (<cite>Farrar</cite>). But it would also
have made them the focus of an intense and
reverent desire to know something with greater
certainty respecting Jesus and his work. And
if the miracle were wrought for the glory of God,
to keep silence respecting it was to weaken if
not to destroy its intended effect. (3) That the
Synoptists confine themselves to a narrative of
Christ’s Galilean ministry and exclude all the
events in Judea prior to the Passion week (<cite>Meyer</cite>).
But this does not explain the omission of this
miracle; it simply reiterates the fact, and leaves
the perplexing problem unsolved. Why should
the Synoptists avoid all mention of miracles and
teachings in Judea, especially one so notable as
this? I agree with Trench in saying that to this
question it is now difficult to find a satisfactory
answer. Possibly Peter, from whom Mark is
believed to have derived all his information, and
Matthew were not present, and each may have
limited himself to facts actually witnessed by
them. This still leaves Luke’s omission of the
miracle unexplained.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The significance of this miracle as an evidence
of Christ’s divine character, authority and mission
has always been felt, even by the more
resolute unbelievers in historic Christianity.
Thus Spinoza declared that “could he have
persuaded himself of the truth of the raising of
Lazarus, he would have broken in pieces his
whole system, and would have embraced without
repugnance the ordinary faith of Christians.”
Various rationalistic explanations have been attempted,
of which the chief are the following:
(1) The mythical (<cite>Strauss</cite>), <i>i. e.</i>, that the story is
a myth which grew up out of some slight foundation,
assumed its present form in the second or
third century, and then was embodied in this
narrative by an ecclesiastical forger, who used
John’s name to give sanction to his story. (2)
That the story was created by the writer for the
purpose of illustrating the truth that Christ is
the resurrection and the life, and that it was
developed by him out of some conversation of
Jesus, or perhaps out of the parable of Lazarus
and the rich man, or possibly out of some incident
in the life of Lazarus. It is even suggested
that Nain is an abbreviation of Bethany, and that
the narratives of the resurrection of Lazarus and
of the widow of Nain’s son have a common origin
(<cite>Schenkel</cite>). To such straits is naturalism reduced
in dealing with the miraculous. (3) That the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
death of Lazarus was apparent, not real; that
the resurrection was a fraud contrived by the
friends of Jesus in order to give <i lang="fr">eclat</i> to his
anticipated entry into Jerusalem, and that to this
fraud he lent himself, in a moment of intense
fanatical enthusiasm (<cite>Renan</cite>). The various explanations
are stated more in detail by Meyer,
but may all be reduced to these three: a denial
that John wrote the account; a suggestion that
he invented it, building on a very slight foundation;
and a suspicion that it was a fraud perpetrated
by Lazarus and the sisters and acquiesced
in by Jesus. The only alternative is belief in the
miracle. The evidence of John’s authorship of
the Fourth Gospel (see <a href="#Page_3">Introduction</a>) refutes the
first hypothesis; the simplicity of the narrative
and the character of John, the second; the character
of Christ himself, the third. The narrative
itself is neither ideal nor dogmatic, neither an
artistic picture nor a concealed argument. It is a
perfectly colorless narrative of events concerning
which there was no possible room for mistake.
The writer does not draw from the narrative any
conclusion; he does not say that any miracle
was wrought or even that the dead was raised.
He simply tells his readers what he saw and
heard, and leaves them to draw their own conclusions.
He was with Jesus beyond Jordan;
word came to them that Lazarus was sick;
Jesus remained where he was two days; then
he told the disciples that Lazarus was dead;
when they reached Bethany they found a scene
of mourning; the friends had come according to
Jewish custom to console the sister’s family;
both sisters stated impliedly and reproachfully
that Lazarus was dead; when they arrived at
the grave, one of them said that he had been
dead four days, and that <span style="white-space:nowrap;">corruption—though</span>
this apparently was only her <span style="white-space:nowrap;">presumption—had</span>
already commenced; Christ directed the stone
to be rolled away, commanded in a loud voice,
“Lazarus, come forth,” and he came forth
bound in his grave-clothes. A scientific commission
could not have reported the facts with
more absolute impartiality. The writer expresses
no opinion whatever respecting the occurrence.
This is not the method of an idealist who has
invented the occurrence for the purpose of
glorifying his Master, or of a dogmatist who
has written it to prove a doctrine; it is the language
of a pre-eminently honest, fair-minded and
impartial witness. And upon this narrative the
great mass of readers and students have come
to but one <span style="white-space:nowrap;">conclusion—that</span> to which both friend
and foe came at the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">time—that</span> it was a genuine
resurrection of the dead, a great and notable
miracle.</p>

<p>An instructive parallel may be traced between
the experience of these sisters in their sorrow
and that of many a Christian household since.
(1) <i>The burden of grief.</i> When the sisters first
sent for Christ to come, he delayed. Still he
often delays to answer our petitions. The house
of mourning is sometimes a Christless house, not
only because of our infirmity (<span class="muchsmaller">Psalm 77:10</span>), but
also because of his will. We, like our Master,
seem sometimes to be forsaken of our God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
27:46</span>). (2) <i>The aggravation of grief.</i> Both sisters
approach Christ with an “if”:—“If thou hadst
been here my brother had not died.” But his
death was not the result of an “if,” but for the
glory of God. There is no “if”; nothing ever
<em>happens</em>. Even the cup which Judas, Caiaphas,
Herod and Pilate mingle for Christ is the cup
which his Father gives him (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch18_14">18:14</a>; Acts 2:23;
4:27, 28</span>). (3) <i>The sympathy of Christ.</i> The tears of
Jesus are a witness to the breadth and depth of
the divine sympathy. He feels the anguish of
our <em>present</em> sorrow though he stands by a grave
so soon to be opened, perceives prophetically the
resurrection so soon to take place, and knows
that weeping is but for the night and joy cometh
in the morning. See <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 4:15, 16. (4) <i>The true
and false conception of death.</i> We too often
imagine, as Martha, the believer awaiting in
Hades a future resurrection and a remote restoration
to life. Our hearts are dead because
buried in the grave of our loved ones. To us
Christ declares here that the believer never dies,
but steps at once from the lower to the higher
life, through the grave into heavenly companionship
(<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 23:43; <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 1:23</span>). (5) <i>The power of
Christ.</i> This scene is a witness to the truth that
all the dead shall hear his voice and come forth
in resurrection. Death is but a sleep; from it
he will awaken all that sleep in him (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Daniel">Dan.</abbr> 12:2;
John <a href="#ch5_21">5:21-29</a>; <a href="#ch6_39">6:39</a>; 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 15:26, 54; 2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 4:14; <abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 3:4;
1 <abbr title="Thessalonians">Thess.</abbr> 4:14-17; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 1:18; 20:14</span>). (6) <i>A parable of
redemption.</i> Sin a spiritual death; Christ the
spiritual life-giver.</p>

were placemen, and feared the loss of their dignities
and authority in the utter overthrow of
the nation, which did, indeed, subsequently take
place. But why should they fear this from any
increase of Christ’s popularity? Not, as Augustine
interprets, because he would persuade all
men to live peaceful lives, and so prevent any
successful revolt against the Roman government.
In common with all the Jews, they expected

 Luke 24:46.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><b>49, 50.</b> Caiaphas puts boldly into words
thoughts which others less unscrupulous dared
not phrase. He overrules all scruples, whether
those of conscience against the murder of an
innocent man and evident prophet, or those of
the Pharisaic party against appealing to the
Roman government to put a prophet to death,
which was necessary to carry out their purpose
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 27:1, 2, note</span>).—&#8203;This he does by a Jesuitical
casuistry: It is better that one innocent man
should die than that the nation should be destroyed.
Thus a pretended patriotism is made
to cover a proposed judicial murder. The argument
is that of an unprincipled politician: the
end justifies the means. The signification here
and in verse <a href="#ch11_51">51</a> of the phrase “high priest <em>that
year</em>” is somewhat uncertain. Caiaphas, the
son-in-law of Annas, really held the office from
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 27 to <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 36 or 37. The high priesthood
was originally a life office. It was now bestowed
and taken away by the Romans at their will.
In 107 years there were twenty-seven appointees.
I am inclined to think the language here a sarcastic
reference to the degenerate nature of the
office; John refuses to give to Caiaphas the
honor once but no longer due to the high priesthood.
Prof. Fisher (<cite>Beginnings of Christianity</cite>)
explains it “on account of the supreme importance
which ‘that year’ of the trial and crucifixion
of Jesus had in his (John’s) mind.” The
language of Caiaphas here agrees with his course
in <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:62, 67. He was an unscrupulous,
vehement, and self-seeking ecclesiastical politician,
such a leader as is often produced by a
degenerate and turbulent era.</p>

<p><b>51, 52.</b> The meaning of the Evangelist is
plain. It is not merely that by accommodation
a prophetic reference to Christ’s sacrifice can
be put upon the words of Caiaphas, but that,
unwittingly, he prophesied of that death and its
signification. So Balaam prophesied blessing to
Israel despite himself (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Numbers">Numb.</abbr>, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 23</span>). “He who
believed in no angel or spirit was compelled to
be the spokesman of the Divine Word, even
when he was plotting his death. Strange and
awful reflection! And yet so it must <span style="white-space:nowrap;">be—so</span>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
experience shows us continually that it is. Our
words are not our own; we are no lords over
them whatever we may think.”—(<cite>Maurice.</cite>) Observe
the two truths connected with the atonement
here indicated: (1) that Jesus Christ dies
for the nation which by its constitutional rulers
is plotting his death; he dies for sinners, not for
the righteous (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr>
5:6-8</span>); (2) by his death he
gathers into <em>one</em>, <i>i. e.</i>, into one nation or kingdom
(<span class="muchsmaller">see <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
21:43, note</span>) the children of God from
every nation under the heavens (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 8:11; John

“The cross was emphatically a message to mankind,
to all tribes and races within the circle of

for rebels and slaves. It is a thought which possessed
the minds of all the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">apostles—of</span> none

the eagle had tried to do. It was to bind men

<p><b>54.</b> The site of Ephraim is involved in some
uncertainty. The “wilderness” probably designates
the wild uncultivated hill country northeast
of Jerusalem, lying between the central
towns and the Jordan valley. Dr. Robinson
identifies Ephraim with the Ophrah referred to
in <abbr title="Joshua">Josh.</abbr> 18:23; 1 <abbr title="Samuel">Sam.</abbr> 13:17, the Ephraim or
Ephram referred to in 2 <abbr title="Chronicles">Chron.</abbr> 13:19, and the
modern et-Taiyibeh, and Ewald supposes it to
be the same Ephraim near which occurred the
murder of Amnon (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Samuel">Sam.</abbr> 13:23</span>). Taiyibeh is four
or five miles east of Bethel and sixteen from
Jerusalem, is situated on a conspicuous conical
hill, and commands an extended view over the
whole eastern slope, the valley of the Jordan
and the Dead Sea. But the identification with
Taiyibeh is only hypothetical. See <cite>Andrews’ Life
of our Lord</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 385. Christ must have returned
to this place immediately after the resurrection
of Lazarus, and his place of retirement was evidently
unknown to the public (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch11_57">57</a></span>). The “disciples”
who abode there with him undoubtedly
included the twelve, but may have also included
others. The length of his stay is uncertain. If
the chronology which I have adopted (<span class="muchsmaller">see <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 11,</span>
<a href="#Note_ch11"><span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Preliminary">Prel.</abbr> Note</span></a>), be the correct one, it could only have
been for two or three weeks, not five or six
weeks as supposed by Andrews and Ellicott. It
is not improbable that the special instructions
concerning prayer, reported by Luke, were given
during this period of retirement (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 11:1-8: 18:1-14</span>).
There is nothing in Luke to fix the time
or place of these instructions; but as Christ was
accustomed to draw his illustrations from circumstances
and events occurring about him, it
is probable that at least the parable of the Pharisee
and the publican was given in or near Judea.
From Ephraim Christ went up to Jerusalem to
attend the last Passover, and to his passion there.

parts of the country: not only from Palestine,

Jews were scattered. (See Acts 2:9-11.)—<b>To

were required by the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> before the

purify themselves before any important event
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 35:2; <abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> 19:10, 11</span>), and were accustomed to

prior to the Passover (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Chronicles">Chron.</abbr> 30:13-20</span>).—&#8203;<b>Then
sought they for Jesus</b>, etc. “Verse 56
graphically describes the restless curiosity of
these country people, who were collected in
groups in the temple and discussing the approaching
arrival of Jesus.”—(<cite>Godet.</cite>) His miracles
and teachings in Galilee and Perea, and above all
the resurrection of Lazarus, led his friends and
<i lang="la">quasi</i> disciples to expect his immediate revelation
of himself as the Messiah (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 19:11</span>); while
the fact that the Sanhedrim had pronounced
against him and given orders for his arrest
coupled with his sudden disappearance, led
others to think that he had fled from the country,
or at least would for the present conceal
himself (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>

the first <span lang="el">καὶ</span> is spurious). This is stated as an
explanation of the doubt of the people whether
Christ would appear or no. Godet’s suggestions
that the order was given to intimidate Christ
and his disciples is reasonable; for it could not
have been difficult to ascertain Christ’s place of
retreat, and when he emerged from it, and came
up with peculiar publicity to the feast, no attempt
was made to arrest him. According to a

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
Hebrew tradition, as reported by Lightfoot, an
officer of the Sanhedrim, during the forty days
preceding this Passover, “publicly proclaimed
that this man, who by his imposture had seduced
the people, ought to be stoned, and that any one
who could say aught in his defence was to come
forward and speak. But no one doing so, he was
hanged on the evening of the Passover.” To
some such public proclamation John here perhaps
refers.</p>

<p><abbr title="Chapter">Ch.</abbr> 12:1-11. ANOINTING OF JESUS BY MARY.—&#8203;<span class="smcap">A
costly expression of a fervent love is not
waste.—&#8203;Hypocrisy sets philanthropy and piety
in contrast.—&#8203;None are so deaf as they that will
not hear.</span></p>


<p><a id="Note_ch12"></a><span class="smcap">Preliminary Note.</span>—This anointing is not to
be confounded with that of which Luke (<span class="muchsmaller">7:36-50</span>)
gives an account. The reasons for distinguishing
it from that anointing I have stated in the
preliminary note there. This anointing is not
mentioned by Luke. It is reported by Matthew
(<span class="muchsmaller">26:6-13</span>) and Mark (<span class="muchsmaller">14:3-9</span>). It is true that some
harmonists have supposed two distinct anointings
in Bethany, but that opinion is entertained by
very few scholars and by none of the moderns,
and is not a reasonable hypothesis; the differences
between John’s account and those of
Matthew and Mark are not greater than might
have been expected in accounts given by independent
witnesses. Matthew and Mark say that
Mary anointed Jesus’ head, John that she
anointed Jesus’ feet; but certainly she may have
anointed both the head and the feet. The principal
difference lies in the fact that Matthew
and Mark impliedly place the anointing two days
before the Paschal feast (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:2; Mark 14:1</span>),
while John impliedly places it six days before
the feast (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch12_1">1</a></span>). The chronology is uncertain;
some scholars adopt that of Matthew and Mark
(<cite>Robinson</cite>, <cite>Geo. W. Clark</cite>, <cite>Hackett</cite>)—&#8203;others, that
of John (<cite>Townsend</cite>, <cite>Andrews</cite>, <cite>Alford</cite>). The former
of these opinions appears to me the more probable
for reasons stated in the note on Matthew
26:6-16. In such a case as this, where there
appears to be a conflict in the chronology of the
evangelists, neither of whom puts any emphasis
upon chronological data or gives what may
properly be called a date, we may reasonably
allow the order of events to be determined by a
consideration of the probable way in which one
event leads on to another. In this case the discourses
of Jesus in the temple and the overthrow
of the ambitious hopes of Judas Iscariot naturally
led to his complaint at this anointing, and Christ’s
sharp rebuke of his spirit here naturally led in
turn to his final act of treachery. The note of
time afforded by John in verses <a href="#ch12_1">1</a>
and <a href="#ch12_12">12</a>, though
they certainly indicate that the anointing took
place prior to the triumphal procession, are not
conclusive; for verses 2-9 may be regarded as
parenthetical. Thus Dr. Hackett: “John is the
only one of the evangelists who speaks of the
Saviour stopping at Bethany on the way between
Bethany and Jerusalem. Hence, this feast being
the principal event which John associates with
Bethany during these last days, he not unnaturally
inserts the account of the feast immediately
after the speaking of the arrival at Bethany.
But having (so to speak) discharged his mind of
that recollection, he then turns back and resumes
the historical order, namely, that on the
next day after coming to Bethany Jesus made
his public entry into Jerusalem as related by the
Synoptists.” We suppose, then, that after the
tarry in Ephraim Christ came up to the Passover;
stopped at Jericho, where occurred the healing
of the blind man, the conversion of Zaccheus,
and the parable of the ten pounds (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 18:35 to
19:28</span>); from Jericho proceeded to Jerusalem,
stopping on the way at Bethany, where, perhaps,
he spent the Sabbath; entered Jerusalem in
triumph on the following day, and drove from
the temple the traders (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 19:28-48</span>), and there
gave the instructions recorded more or less by
all the Synoptists, but most fully by Matthew
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr> 21:12 to 25:46</span>); and thence retreated to
Bethany, where this supper, made for him by
Martha and her sister Mary, led directly to the
conspiracy of Judas Iscariot for his betrayal
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
26:14-16</span>). See <cite>Tabular Harmony</cite>, page 45.</p>

<p><b>1, 2. Six days before the passover.</b> This
note of time is quite inconclusive, because it
is uncertain whether the day of Christ’s arrival
and the first day of the passover should be excluded
or included, or one should be excluded
and the other included, and also because it is
uncertain on which day of the month the passover
is to be considered as having begun. For
various chronological views, see <cite>Andrews’ Life
of our Lord</cite>, page 397. The most probable
hypothesis, and the one commonly accepted,
makes Christ arrive at Bethany on Friday night,
spending there the Sabbath and going on to

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
Jerusalem on the following day, the first day of
the week.—&#8203;<b>Came to Bethany.</b> A well known
village about fifteen stadia (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch11_18">11:18</a></span>), that is,
about a mile and a half, east of Jerusalem, on the
eastern slope of the Mount of Olives, not far from
the point at which the road to Jericho begins its
more sudden descent toward the valley. Fruit
and other trees growing <span style="white-space:nowrap;">around—olive,</span> almond,
and <span style="white-space:nowrap;">oak—give</span> the spot an air of seclusion and
repose. It is not mentioned in the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>, but is
intimately associated with the life of our Lord.
Here Lazarus was raised from the dead; here
Christ found a secluded retreat and the refreshment
of friendship during the stormy periods
of his ministry in Jerusalem; thence he ascended
when the cloud received him from the side of
his disciples. The present village, El-Azariyeh,
is a ruinous and wretched hamlet of some twenty
families, the inhabitants of which display even
less than the ordinary Eastern thrift and industry.—&#8203;<b>They
made him a supper.</b> The word
<dfn>supper</dfn> (<span lang="el">δεῖπνος</span>) represents the chief meal of the
Jews and also of the Greeks and Romans, taken
at evening after the labors of the day were over,
and sometimes prolonged into the night. The
same word is sometimes used to signify a banquet
or feast (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 23:6; Mark 6:21; Luke 14:12;
20:46; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 19:9</span>). Who made the supper is not
directly stated, by either John or the other
Evangelists. It was in the house of one Simon
the leper (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:6; Mark 14:3</span>). Godet supposes
that he was a leper who had been healed by
Jesus and who claimed the privilege of entertaining,
in the name of the rest of the inhabitants
of Bethany, Jesus, who had conferred on their
town so great a favor by raising Lazarus from
the dead. This seems to me a wild hypothesis
on the part of a very sober and cautious scholar.
The fact that Martha served is at least an indication
that the supper was given at the house of
Martha and Mary, who were certainly Christ’s
most intimate friends in the village. There is
nothing to indicate that Simon was present or
had been cured. The common hypothesis is
more reasonable, that he was the father of the
sisters, or possibly the husband of Martha, and
was either dead or through his leprosy exiled
from his home, and that the house is described
by the two Synoptists as his house because he
was a well-known resident, and also because they
wished to avoid concentrating the attention of
the Pharisees, who had already determined upon
the death of Lazarus, on him and his two sisters.
They are not mentioned by name in the Synoptical
narratives. The difference in character
between Martha and Mary, as indicated both by
their conduct here and the incident narrated in
Luke 10:38-42, is one of those incidental coincidences
which attest the historic truth of the
Gospels.</p>

<p><b>3-6. A pound of ointment of spikenard.</b>
Mark and John both add a word characterizing
this ointment, which is not elsewhere found, in
either Biblical or classic Greek (<span lang="el">πιστικῆς</span>). Commentators
disagree in their translation of this
word, and the English translators seem to have
avoided the difficulty by omitting it altogether.
Some scholars derive it from a Greek verb (<span lang="el">πίνω</span>)
meaning <dfn>to drink</dfn>, and suppose it to indicate
that the ointment was liquid, perhaps drinkable.
By other scholars it is derived from the verb
(<span lang="el">πιστεύω</span>) <dfn>to believe</dfn>, and is supposed to signify a
trustworthy or a reliable ointment; that is, one
that was pure or unadulterated. This is the
more probable meaning. Spikenard was liable
to all kinds of adulteration. Pliny enumerates
nine plants with which it might be mixed in preparing
it for the market. The
spikenard appears to have been
procured from an Indian plant
of the family of <i lang="la">valeriana</i>, and
to have been imported from India
by way of Arabia. It was highly
prized among the ancients.
Horace, writing to Virgil, asks
his guests to bring as contribution
to the feast a little spikenard,
and by way of equivalent
he would match it with a cask of
wine. The use of fragrant oils
and ointments were very common
among the ancients, who
anointed themselves twice or
three times a day in order that the
delicious fragrance might not be
dissipated. The wealthier classes
carried their ointments and perfumes
in small boxes of costly
material and beautiful workmanship.
This ointment was contained
in an alabaster box (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
26:7; Mark 14:3</span>). This box Mary
broke, pouring the ointment first
on Christ’s head and then on his
feet. There is doubt as to the
meaning of the expression “she
brake the box;” some suppose
that she simply broke the seal;
others, that she broke off the
neck of the box with a sharp
blow, so pouring out the whole
ointment as an offering to Christ,
a very little of which would have
sufficed for the purpose of an ordinary anointing.
For an illustration of alabaster boxes see Luke
7:38, note.—&#8203;<b>Very costly.</b> A pound was an
enormous quantity to lavish on a single anointing.—&#8203;<b>Wiped
his feet with her hair.</b> So did the
woman who was a sinner (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 7:38</span>). But there
is this characteristic difference between the two
cases: the unknown woman in Luke washed his
feet with her tears, and it was the tears which
she wiped off with her hair. Here there are no
tears; all is joy and gladness.—&#8203;<b>And the house
was filled with the odor of the ointment.</b>
The service rendered to Christ did not stop with
him alone. Such service never does; it becomes
fragrant to all who are within the reach of its
influence.—&#8203;<b>One of his disciples.</b> The objection
was started by Judas Iscariot. The others,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
however, shared this feeling; they too had indignation
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:8; Mark 18:4</span>), and regarded Mary’s
action as wasteful. To prosaic natures the expression
of love always seems a waste, but to
ardent natures nothing seems too costly to express
the enthusiasm of love.—&#8203;<b>For three hundred
denarii.</b> The denarius, or, as the word is
translated in the New Testament, <em>penny</em>, was a
coin of about seventeen cents in value, but at
that time was a day’s wages (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 20:10</span>). Thus,
this offering of Mary was practically equivalent
to an offering in our time of three hundred dollars.—&#8203;<b>And
given to the poor.</b> A pretended
regard for the poor is often made a cloak for an
attack upon the Christian church, and especially
upon Christian worship. In the case of Judas,
as in many other cases, it was but a cover for a
more sordid motive, but it served its purpose.—&#8203;<b>But
because he had the bag.</b> Possibly a <em>box</em>;
more probably a money bag or purse (Latin, <i lang="la">sacculus</i>),
in which the funds
of Jesus and his disciples
were carried. These funds
were doubtless small and
were made up of gifts from
other disciples (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 8:3</span>).
This is implied by the language
here, “what was put
therein,” signifying literally
what had been cast therein; that is, by
friends of Jesus.—&#8203;<b>And bare what was put
therein.</b> The original is capable of being translated
“<dfn>purloined</dfn> what was put therein.” This
is the significance given to it by most of the
scholars (<cite>Meyer</cite>, <cite>Alford</cite>, <cite>De Wette</cite>, <cite>Godet</cite>).</p>

<p><b>7, 8.</b> If we combine the reports of the three
Evangelists, it will appear that Christ’s words
were substantially as follows: “Let her alone.
Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath
wrought a good work upon me; she hath
done what she could; against the day of my
burying hath she kept this, and is come beforehand
to anoint my body for the burial. The
poor always ye have with you, and whensoever
ye will ye may do them good; but me ye have
not always.” <em>Let her alone</em> is the language of
sharp rebuke. Christ was indignant at the
hypocrisy which made a pretended consideration
of the poor an excuse for attacking and condemning
an act of love towards himself. <em>Why
trouble ye the woman?</em> indicates that Mary was
herself abashed and downcast by the criticism of
the twelve. Perhaps, as Maurice says, “she could
not herself have answered Judas Iscariot’s complaining
question.” <cite>For she hath wrought a good
work upon me</cite>, is a strong expression of approbation
of an act which was service only as it was
an expression of love. The word rendered <cite>good</cite>
is literally <dfn>beautiful</dfn>; but with the Greeks, who
were an æsthetic race, the word expressive of
moral beauty was one of the highest commendation.
To express love to Christ is to render a
good work unto Christ. <cite>She hath done what she
could</cite>, commends Mary in the same spirit in which
the poor widow was commended (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 12:44</span>).
Whether her act was wise or not was not to be
questioned. It was the outpouring of a heart
full of love, and there is no condemnation to
those who are thus in Christ Jesus. There is
some question respecting the reading of the
phrase <cite>Against the day of my burying hath she
kept this</cite>. Some critics (<cite>Meyer</cite>, <cite>Alford</cite>) understand
its meaning to be, <dfn>Against the day of my
burying let her preserve this</dfn>. And Meyer supposes
that only a part of the ointment was used in the
anointing, and that Christ expresses the idea
that the rest is not to be sold for the poor, but
to be preserved to complete Mary’s unfinished
act. But there is no question respecting the
reading of the text in Matthew. That the anointing
was treated by Christ as a prophetic act is
more in accordance both with the reports of the
other Evangelists and with the spirit of the
entire narrative. Christ’s declaration then is,
not that Mary should reserve the rest of the ointment
for the anointing of his corpse, nor that
she had deliberately and intentionally preserved
it for a prophetic anointing, but that it was in
accordance with a divine purpose that she had
poured it upon him while he lived. His body
was not anointed at the time of his death, the
completion of the funeral honors being prevented
by his resurrection (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 16:1, 2</span>).—&#8203;<cite>The
poor always ye have with you, and whensoever ye will
ye may do them good</cite>, is founded upon the great
principle that philanthropy needs no special emotion,
only opportunity, and that is never wanting;
while the expression of love can only be made
when the love itself burns ardently in the heart,
and that must of necessity be occasional and
exceptional; in other words, philanthropy may
always exhibit itself in acts of charity, but emotion
can only occasionally exhibit itself in acts
of reverence and love. Matthew and Mark add
the declaration by Christ, that <cite>Wheresoever this
Gospel shall be preached in the whole world over,
shall also this that this woman hath done be told for
a memorial for her</cite>. See <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:13, note.</p>

That is, they were at this time consulting. While
the people were drawn to Lazarus by curiosity,
and others were led by the story of his resurrection,
confirmed by himself, to believe that
Jesus was the Messiah, the chief priests in Jerusalem
were consulting how they might get rid
both of Jesus and of the witness to his divine
power. Thus they demonstrate the truth of
Christ’s saying, “Neither will they believe though
one rose from the dead” (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 16:31</span>).—&#8203;<b>Believed
on Jesus.</b> That is, they believed that he was
the Messiah. Nor was this a mere intellectual
opinion. It involved attachment to Christ and
hope in him; a looking forward to a revelation of
himself in some miraculous and decisive display
of divine power against the Romans. The period
was one of a brief but great popularity, which
accounts for the triumphal entry into Jerusalem,
and the Pharisees’ fear of the people which kept
them from openly arresting Christ during his
teaching in the temple on the eventful days that
immediately followed.</p>

The statement that some from Jerusalem took
palm branches and came out to meet the procession
as it approached the city is peculiar to John.
So also is his account of the effect produced on
the Pharisees (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>

19:39, that some of the Pharisees called on

suppressed hostility. <em>The next day</em>, verse <a href="#ch12_12">12</a>,
might mean the day after the anointing, but I
believe means the day after the visit to Bethany,
the account of the anointing being parenthetical.
See <a href="#Note_ch12"><abbr title="Preliminary">Prel.</abbr> Note</a>. Those who came out to meet
Jesus are not described as <em>Jews</em>, and may have

<p><b>19-22. The Pharisees therefore said
among themselves.</b> Some among the Pharisees
were friendly to Jesus, but dared not come
out openly in his favor. Of this number was
Nicodemus. To the same class belonged the
lawyer that answered Christ discreetly and the
ruler whom it is said Jesus loved (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 10:21; 12:34</span>).
Chrysostom supposes that the Pharisees here
referred to were of this sort, and that their language
is that of remonstrance against the endeavors
of the rest to destroy him. The language
seems to me rather that of approval of
Caiaphas’ counsel. They point to the fact that
the cautious methods have availed nothing. So
Bengel and most modern critics.—&#8203;<b>The world
is gone out after him.</b> Literally <dfn>are departing
after him</dfn>; that is, are leaving us, the old
and acknowledged teachers, to go after him, this
new and unordained rabbi. The <dfn>world</dfn> signifies

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
the multitude, not especially the wicked; but it
is a term of reproach.—&#8203;<b>But there were certain
Greeks.</b> <em>But</em>, not <em>and</em>. The particle (<span lang="el">δέ</span>)
is adversative, and indicates a contrast between
the persons mentioned in the previous sentence
and those here referred to. So do the terms
<em>Pharisees</em>, who were Hebrews of the Hebrews,
and <em>Greeks</em> who were, not Jews dispersed in
Greece and coming up thence to the feast, but
men who belonged to the Greek nationality and
had adopted the Hebrew religion, <i>i. e.</i>, Greek
proselytes. On the character of these proselytes
from foreign nations, see Matthew 23:15, note.
That these were Greeks, not Grecian Jews, is
evident from the word employed to describe the
Greeks (<span lang="el">Ἕλληνες</span>), which is one signifying nationality,
not location; that they were proselytes is
evident from the characterization as <em>among them
which were accustomed</em> (present participle signifying
habit—<cite>Meyer</cite>) <em>to come up to worship at the
feast</em>. They were of the same character as the
centurion whose son Christ healed, the Cornelius
who sent for Peter, and the Eunuch to whom
Philip preached (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 8:7-10; Acts 8:27-40; <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 10</span>).
The pilgrims to Jerusalem were increased considerably
in the increasing decay of the polytheistic
worship of Greece and Rome, with such
converts to the simple and sublime monotheism
of Judea.—&#8203;<b>The same came therefore to
Philip.</b> Why to Philip is purely a matter of
conjecture. In fact, Philip and Andrew are both
Greek names, and the only names of Greek origin
among the twelve.—&#8203;<b>Sir</b> (<span lang="el">κύριε</span>). The term is the
same one translated <dfn>lord</dfn> when used in addressing
Christ. Its fair equivalent in the English language
is Sire. They address Philip with marked
respect.—&#8203;<b>We would see Jesus.</b> Rather, <cite>we
have desired</cite> to see him. They assume that a
private interview will be readily granted them.
That this is what they desire is evident, because
Christ was publicly teaching in the temple during
the four days preceding his arrest, and therefore
it was very easy for them to both see and hear
him in public. The motive of this request may
probably have been a mixed one; partly a curiosity
to see and hear more of this extraordinary
Rabbi, partly a real moral and spiritual appreciation
of and drawing to him; possibly a dim
and unconfessed wonder whether he might possibly
be the promised Messiah. Stier compares
this visit to that of the Magi at the birth, one a
coming to the cradle, the other to the cross.
Godet refers to the tradition narrated by Eusebius,
that an embassy was sent by the king of
Edessa, in Syria, to invite Jesus to take up his
abode with him, and to furnish him such a royal
welcome as should compensate him for the obstinacy
with which the Jews rejected him.—&#8203;<b>Andrew
and Philip tell Jesus.</b> The two were of
the same city (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_44">1:44</a></span>). The fact that Philip takes
Andrew with him is one of the not unfrequent
indications of the awe with which, despite the
fullness and even familiarity of his love, Christ
inspired his most intimate disciples (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 9:45;
Mark 9:32, etc.</span>). So Bengel: “Philip feared to
introduce the Greeks alone; with a friend he
ventured to do so.” It is to be remembered,
however, that the request would seem a doubtful
one to them, since the Rabbinical theology forbade
to teach the truth to a Gentile, who was
regarded as unworthy of it, and Jesus himself
had confined his ministry to the lost sheep of the
house of Israel (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 10:5; 15:24</span>).</p>

<p><b>23-26. But Jesus answered them.</b> <em>But</em>
(<span lang="el">δέ</span>) not <em>and</em>; the adversative particle indicates
that the request was refused. So also does the
word (<span lang="el">ἀποκρίνομαι</span>) rendered <dfn>answered</dfn>, literally
to distinguish, then to reject after inquiry; then
to make response; but primarily a negative
response. So also, it appears to me, does the
discourse which follows. Neither, however, is
conclusive. Tholuck apparently thinks the request
granted; Meyer supposes that Christ intended
to grant the request, but was interrupted
by the voice from heaven; a quite improbable
conjecture. Whether the interview was granted
or refused, is a point on which John lays no
emphasis. He narrates the request only because
it leads to a brief utterance by Jesus, called out
by it, and which he could not intelligibly report
without reporting the incident which led to it.—&#8203;<b>The
hour is come that the Son of man
should be glorified.</b> <cite>Hour</cite> is here equivalent
to the more general word <dfn>time</dfn> or <dfn>era</dfn>. The
prophets of the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> foretell the ingathering
of the Gentiles through the Messiah. This is
both his glory and the glory of the Jewish nation
in him (<span class="muchsmaller">Psalm 2:8; Isaiah 53:11</span>). In this application
of these Greek proselytes, Christ sees a prophetic
indication of the time when, with a profounder
meaning, the Gentile world will everywhere put
forth a request to see Jesus, when, being lifted
up, he will draw all men unto him, when they
will come from the north and the south, the east

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
and the west, to sit down with Jesus in his kingdom
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 8:11</span>), when he will break down the
partition wall between Jew and Gentile (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr>
2:14</span>), and gather into one nation the dispersed
children of God (<span class="muchsmaller">John
<a href="#ch11_52">11:52</a>; <abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 3:11;
<abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 7:9</span>).
The term <dfn>Son of man</dfn> is here, as always when
used by Christ in reference to himself, equivalent
to <dfn>the Messiah</dfn>.—&#8203;<b>Verily, verily, I say unto
you.</b> A customary prelude to an important
saying (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:18, note</span>). Here it is used by Christ
to emphasize a truth which the disciples had
already proved themselves so loth to receive that
they were practically unable to understand it
(<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 9:32; Luke 18:34</span>), namely, that the Messiah’s
death must precede this ingathering of the Gentiles
and prepare the way for it, and itself become
the instrument for its accomplishment.
He states this truth, first under a figure drawn
from nature (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch12_24">24</a></span>), then as a general law, alike
applicable to the Master and his disciples
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch12_25">25</a></span>).—&#8203;<b>Except
a kernel of wheat fall into the
ground and die, it abideth alone.</b> In the
granary it is <em>safe</em>, but <em>useless</em>. Its death is the
precursor of its usefulness. Paul employs the
same figure in a different connection in 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr>
15:36. Christ embodies it in the Lord’s Supper,
which reminds us of this law of self-sacrifice.
It is the wheat ground to powder that makes the
bread, and the body bruised that makes the
bread of life; it is the grape crushed that makes
the wine, and the blood poured out as a libation
that makes the wine of life. This truth of self-sacrifice
symbolized by nature is one of the universal
laws of spiritual life.—&#8203;<b>He that loveth
his life shall lose it.</b> The <dfn>life</dfn> or <dfn>soul</dfn> (the
same Greek word, <span lang="el">ψυχή</span>, is indiscriminately rendered
by both English words in our English version)
is the æsthetic and intellectual part of man
in contrast with the spiritual nature (<span lang="el">ὅ πνεῦμα</span>).
If one gives himself to the saving of this soul or
life he destroys it; for this is but the adjunct of
the spiritual nature, and perishes if that is left
to perish. “Lange points out that this saying
involved a condemnation of Hellenism. For
what was Greek civilization but human life cultivated
from the view-point of enjoyment, and
withdrawn from the law of sacrifice.”—(<cite>Godet.</cite>)
The same judgment Paul re-affirms in 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr>
1:18-21; and it is equally applicable as a judgment
of modern unreligious culture. Culture
without religion destroys what it would preserve.—&#8203;<b>He
that hateth his life in this
world shall guard it unto life eternal.</b>
Two different Greek words (<span lang="el">ψυχή</span> and <span lang="el">ζωή</span>) are
rendered by the same English word <dfn>life</dfn> in the
two clauses of this sentence. Yet if we were to
render it, <cite>He that hateth his soul shall guard it unto
life eternal</cite>, the rendering would be at least
equally liable to misapprehension. If the reader
understands <em>soul</em> to mean the earthy side of
human nature, in contrast with the spiritual, as
explained above (and this is the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> use of the
term), this substituted rendering will give him
the true meaning of the original. Beware of
understanding <em>hate</em> to mean merely does not
love, or <em>guard</em> as merely equivalent to <em>keep</em>, as it
is rendered in our English version. The meaning
is that he who finds no satisfaction in earthly
sources of enjoyment, who turns away from
them with a sense of satiety that, at least at times,
becomes a generous contempt and a noble loathing,
toward the higher spiritual life which mere
intellectual and æsthetic culture does nothing to
satisfy, is by that very hate protected from the
excesses and the demoralization which of necessity
inheres in a life contented with the provisions
for the earthly nature. The hate inspired
in a noble nature by every unworthy thing is the
best protection against subtle temptations.—&#8203;<b>If
any man would serve me, let him follow
me.</b> This is Christ’s answer to the request of
the Greeks. Service of Christ is to be sought, not
by secret interviews, not by sacred and saintly
communings, which he gives to whom he will,
but by practical following of him in a life of daily
self-sacrifice for others.—&#8203;<b>And where I am,
there shall my servant be.</b> This practical
following is the way that leads to intimate fellowship.
The sacred conversations of Christ with
the twelve, recorded in John, <abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr>
<a href="#ch13_1">13-16</a>, did
not come till for three years they had followed
him, forsaking all things for the sake of his companionship.
This following has the promise both
of heavenly companionship with Christ on earth
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch13_21">14:21-23</a></span>), and eternal companionship with him
in heaven (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:17;
2 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 2:11, 12</span>).—&#8203;<b>If any man
serve me, him will my Father honor.</b> For
it is with the Father, not with the Son, to determine
who shall sit at his right hand and his left
(<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 10:40</span>), who are to receive the honors, what
is to be the allotment of rank in the kingdom of
God. The Christian’s ambition, therefore, is to
be Christ-like in the life of earthly service, and
leave all else to the will of the Father concerning
him.</p>

<p><b>27-29. Now is my soul troubled.</b> Literally,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
<dfn>stirred up, in conflict</dfn>. In <a href="#ch11_33">11:33</a> it is said
that Jesus was indignant in <em>spirit</em>, here that his
<em>soul</em> is in conflict. See note on <a href="#ch11_33">11:33</a>, and on this
contrast between soul and spirit, see above on
verse <a href="#ch12_25">25</a>; the one links man to God, the other
to the animal. At the grave of Lazarus the
higher spiritual nature was indignant at the exhibition
of formalism and false pretence; here
the lower and earthly nature was in conflict
between the instincts of self-preservation and the
impulse of love and duty. “A horror of death
and an ardor of obedience concurred.”—(<cite>Bengel.</cite>)
It was a real struggle; the narration of it refutes
the rationalistic hypothesis that John omitted
the agony at Gethsemane because he desired to
portray a Son of God superior to all trial and
conflict. It illustrates and is interpreted by
<abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 2:18; 4:15; 5:7; see Notes on Temptation
of Christ, <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 4:1-11; and on Lessons
of Gethsemane, <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:36-46.—&#8203;<b>And what
shall I say? Father, save me from this
hour?</b> This is to be taken not affirmatively
but interrogatively. Christ does not first pray
to be delivered from his passion and then
change his mind, recall the prayer and put up
another and a different one. Nor is it uttered
didactically, to teach his disciples. The contrast
between the two petitions is explained
by the precedent declaration, “Now is my soul
in conflict;” the nature of that conflict is hinted
at in the twofold prayer, the first hypothetical,
the second final: Shall I ask my Father to save
me from this hour? (That is the suggestion of
the natural instincts.) No! for this cause came
I unto this hour. Rather, Father, glorify thy
name. (That is the victory of the spiritual nature.)
“The struggle is like one of those fissures
in its crust, which enables science to fathom the
bowels of the earth. It lets us read the very
inmost depths of the Lord’s being.”—(<cite>Godet.</cite>)
Beware of understanding this conflict as one
between the God and the man in the God-man.
The <em>spirit</em> is in every child of God, increasingly
dominant, though in none absolutely, unquestionably
and always supreme as in Jesus Christ.
<em>This hour</em> is the hour of the passion toward
which Christ had steadfastly set his face (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke
9:51</span>) in coming up for the last time to Jerusalem.—&#8203;<b>For
this cause came I unto this hour.</b>
In order to be a sacrifice he had both come from
heaven to earth, and also, at this very moment,
from the safety and comparative popularity of
Perea to Jerusalem.—&#8203;<b>Father, glorify thy
name.</b> <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> Matthew 26:39. In both cases
there is not merely resignation to a superior will,
an invincible fate, but a real and supreme desire
to fulfil that will whatever it may entail.—&#8203;<b>Then
came there a voice from heaven.</b> The
critics since, as the people then, have discussed
whether this was really an articulate voice,
speaking words, or only a sound of thunder
which Christ interpreted as a divine response to
his prayer. The word <dfn>voice</dfn> (<span lang="el">φωνὴ</span>) is not conclusive,
because it signifies sometimes an inarticulate
sound, as of a trumpet, chariots, waters,
thunder, and the like (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 24:31; 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 14:7, 8; John
<a href="#ch3_8">3:8</a>; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 9:9; 6:1; 14:2; 18:22, etc.</span>). But the plain
implication of the narrative is that this was an
articulate voice, the words of which were understood
by others than Jesus, though not by all.
So at Paul’s conversion his companions heard
the <em>sound</em>, but understood not the <em>words</em> of the
voice that spake to him (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 9:7 with 22:9, notes</span>).
This is the view of nearly all evangelical scholars,
<i>e. g.</i>, Alford, Meyer, Godet, etc. The latter’s
illustration is apt: “The whole multitude heard
a noise; but the meaning of the voice was only
perceived by each in proportion to his spiritual
intelligence. Thus the wild beast perceives only
a <em>sound</em> in the human voice; the trained animal
discovers a <em>meaning</em>, a command, for example,
which it immediately obeys; man alone discerns
therein a <em>thought</em>.”—&#8203;Here the multitude (<span lang="el">ὁ ὄχλος</span>,
<dfn>the people</dfn>) did not comprehend; but some (<span lang="el">ἄλλοι</span>,
<dfn>others</dfn>), a smaller number, did.—&#8203;<b>I have both
glorified it and will glorify it again.</b> The
Father had glorified his name by giving Jesus
daily and hourly the power to do and to bear all
that had been laid on him up to that moment;
and he would glorify it by continuing to give
him the power to do and to bear all that should
be laid on him to the end. The prayer and the
promise are both for us. In our passion-hour
true prayer will be the cry, not of the soul, but
of the spirit; a cry, not to be saved from our
Calvary, but to be enabled to glorify our Father’s
name in and through it. And the answer is
interpreted by our experience in the past (<span class="muchsmaller">Psalm
77:10-12</span>); the grace that has been sufficient will
be sufficient to the end.</p>

<p><b>30-33. Not for me but for you.</b> If there
were no articulate words, if Christ simply imputed
to the sound of thunder the meaning,
there would have been in it no value to the
bystanders. This declaration, therefore, seems
to me conclusive that a voice spoke comprehensible

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
words; and even to indicate that the hypothetical
explanation “It thundered,” was not
an honest one.—&#8203;<b>Now is the judgment of this
world.</b> The language is anticipative. Christ
speaks as though the passion on which he was
entering were already accomplished. That passion
he declares will be characterized by a threefold
result: the world will be judged, the devil
conquered and cast out, and the all-conquering
Christ brought in. The judgment of the world
has already begun. It “dates from Good Friday”
(<cite>Godet</cite>). While Christ came not to judge
the world but that the world through him might
be saved, his cross is in fact a judgment-seat,
and men are discriminated morally and spiritually
by their reception of the suffering, self-sacrificing
Redeemer.—&#8203;<b>Now the prince of
this world is cast out.</b> The Prince of this
world was a phrase much used by Jewish writers
to designate the spiritual monarch of the Gentiles
in opposition to the one true God whom
they regarded as in a peculiar sense the God of
Israel. Christ employs their language; he sees
in the application of the Greeks for an interview
with him a prophecy of the time when Satan
will be cast out and all the kingdoms of this
world will become the kingdoms of our Lord
and of his Christ. This he regards as accomplished
<em>now</em>, that is, by the sacrifice of Calvary.
The world’s battle was fought and the victory
won there. The second coming is not to redeem
the world, but to realize for the world the fruits
of redemption, in an established and eternal
kingdom of righteousness, after, by the cross,
humanity has been judged, the devil cast out,
and the redeemed race lifted up into oneness
with Christ Jesus. The passages of the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>,
which imply the continuing influence of the
devil (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 16:20; 2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 4:4; <abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 2:2; 6:12, etc.</span>)
are not inconsistent with Christ’s language here,
because it is prophetic; he speaks of that as
already accomplished which is absolutely certain
to be accomplished by the power of that divine
sacrifice so soon by him to be consummated.—&#8203;<b>And
I, if I be lifted up will draw all men
toward myself.</b> <em>If</em> is not to be rendered as
equivalent to <em>when</em>. The language is sympathetic
with that of verse <a href="#ch12_27">27</a>; it is the last trace
of that soul-storm. His crucifixion was contingent;
it was made, to the last, dependent on his
own voluntary submission. Even in the hour of
his arrest the way of deliverance was open to
him (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:53</span>). He is still, as it were, arguing
with himself. The whole language is that of
<i lang="la">quasi</i> soliloquy. The phrase <em>lifted up
from the earth</em> certainly does not refer to his ascension, as
Meyer interprets it. John’s own interpretation
in the next verse is conclusive on that point.
Apart from inspiration, he, as a sympathetic ear-witness,
is to be trusted as a correct interpreter.
Nor does it refer to the mere physical elevation
from the ground of a foot or two in the crucifixion.
The <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> use of the original word rendered
<dfn>lifted up</dfn> (<span lang="el">ὑψόω</span>) as well as the added words
<cite>from the earth</cite>, is conclusive on that point. To
give a physical interpretation to the phrase is to
belittle and degrade it. The word here rendered
<dfn>lifted up</dfn> is generally rendered <dfn>exalted</dfn> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 11:23;
23:12; Luke 1:52; 14:11</span>), and is used in reference
to Christ’s divine exaltation in consequence of
his voluntary sacrifice (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 2:33; 5:31</span>). The
crucifixion is exaltation because self-sacrifice is
divine glory (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 1:23, 24</span>). <cite>From the earth</cite> is
added to mark the contrast between the kingdom
of the Prince of this world which is to be
overthrown and that of the Prince of Light which
takes its place. The one is of the earth earthy;
the other is not of this world (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch18_36">18:36</a></span>), but <em>over</em>
it, a kingdom lifted up from the world but dominating
it. In each individual soul the kingdom
of God begins, as it began in the world of humanity,
in crucifixion. When we take up our cross
and follow Christ, we are lifted up from the
earth and in us the Prince of this world is cast
out (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 9:49, 50; Luke 14:27, notes</span>). The word <dfn>drawing</dfn>
here refers not primarily to the influence of
the Holy Spirit winning men to Christ
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch7_39">7:39</a>;
<a href="#ch14_18">14:18</a>, <a href="#ch14_19">19</a>; <a href="#ch16_7">16:7</a></span>), certainly not to what theologians
call effectual calling, but to the attractive
power of the cross itself. Self-sacrifice always
draws us toward the sacrificed one, the soldier,
the martyr, the mother; and has drawn all
hearts toward Christ as the pre-eminent martyr.
This is not, however, a promise that all men
shall be actually brought to Christlikeness of
disposition. The original does not imply this.
The preposition <cite>to</cite> (<span lang="el">ηρός</span>) should rather be rendered
<dfn>towards</dfn>; for it indicates <em>direction</em>, not
<em>result</em>, the place or person toward which anything
moves or an affection is directed, not that
to which anything comes or upon which an
affection is finally centered. <cite>All men</cite> must not
be rendered with Calvin as equivalent to “all the
children of God;” nor does it merely mean men
of both Gentile and Jewish origin, <i>i. e.</i>, all classes
of men. Christ’s words need no mending. All
men to whom the simple story of the cross is
told are drawn toward him who gave himself for
us; whether they <em>follow him</em> and become like
him through a like voluntary cross-bearing is
another question. Of that Christ says nothing
here. The whole sentence, then (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verses">vers.</abbr> <a href="#ch12_31">31, 32</a></span>), may
be paraphrased thus: Already is the judgment
of this world beginning to take place; already
is the Prince of this world beginning to be cast
out; and I, if I am faithful to the end in enduring
that cross for which I came into this
hour, will draw all hearts toward me, even
as now these stranger hearts are drawn toward
me.</p>

<b>34-36. We have heard out of the law
that the Messiah abideth forever.</b> They
evidently understand Christ’s language to refer
to his death, at least to his departure from the
earth, and are really perplexed. For the idea
of an earthly Messianic kingdom was so firmly
fixed in the public mind that they were absolutely
incapable of receiving any other; and the
<abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> in many passages does describe that kingdom
as an everlasting one (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 89:36; 145:13; Isaiah
9:5, 7; <abbr title="Daniel">Dan.</abbr> 7:13, 14</span>).—&#8203;<b>Who is this Son of man?</b>
The language is that of sneer. What strange
sort of a Messiah is this, that must die in order
to draw all nations unto him, and enter into his
kingdom?—&#8203;<b>Then Jesus said unto them.</b>
His reply is not responsive to their question. He
rarely if ever replied to sneers.—&#8203;<b>Yet a little
while is the light with you.</b> The commentators
generally regard the phrase <cite>the Light</cite>
as Christ’s designation of himself. So Alford,
Godet, Meyer, among the moderns, and Chrysostom
and Calvin among the older commentators.
But this interpretation entangles the whole sentence.
Christ then bids his auditors to walk,
<i>i. e.</i>, “be not slothful but spiritually active”
(<cite>Meyer</cite>), for the two or three days that intervene
before his death; for his death will bring darkness
on them, and make it impossible for them
to walk intelligently thereafter. The direction
is thus deprived of all significance to us, and is
contradicted by history; for the death of Christ
brought light, not darkness, and was itself the
necessary precursor of highest spiritual activity
in all that believe on him. The <em>light</em> here, as in
Matthew 6:23, is the moral and spiritual nature
of man, that which links him to the divine and
makes it possible for him to become a child of
God. God is the Light of the world (<span class="muchsmaller">1 John 1:5</span>) because
he is the fountain, the central sun which
supplies and keeps alive this moral and spiritual
nature in men. Christ is the Light of the world
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch9_5">9:5</a></span>), because in him this spiritual nature
shone out without any dimness from sin or
moral infirmity. Christians are lights in the
world (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:14</span>), because this spiritual nature in
them is their guide, illuminating them and
through them others. If one follows this inner
light it grows brighter and brighter unto perfect
day (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Proverbs">Prov.</abbr> 4:18</span>); if he disobeys it he quenches it
and goes into moral darkness, losing the very
power of moral and spiritual discrimination (<span class="muchsmaller">1 John
2:8-11</span>). I understand Christ’s meaning then to
be this: You have yet for a little while longer
the light of conscience; it is not utterly quenched.
Beware. Walk according to such light as you
possess, lest utter moral darkness come upon
you. And he who walks in such darkness knows
not the future fate that awaits him. <cite>Walk while
ye have the light</cite> should rather be rendered, <cite>Walk
as ye have the light</cite> (<span lang="el">ὡς</span> not <span lang="el">ἕως</span> is the best reading,
so <cite>Alford</cite>, <cite>Meyer</cite>, etc.); that is, <em>According to the
light ye possess</em>. The phrase <cite>Come upon you</cite> is
hardly forcible enough to express the meaning
of the original (<span lang="el">καταλαμβάνω</span>) which is literally
to <dfn>seize</dfn> or <dfn>take violent possession of</dfn>. See Mark
9:18; John 8:3; 1 <abbr title="Thessalonians">Thess.</abbr> 5:4. <cite>Knoweth not
whither he goeth</cite> indicates the awful mystery which
hangs about the final fate of those who refuse to
follow the light of their own better nature, and
so to accept the light which comes from God
through Jesus Christ his Son.—&#8203;<b>As ye have
the light, have faith in the light, that ye
may become the children of light.</b> Observe
the difference between this rendering,
which accurately follows the original, and that
of the English version, from which it differs in
three important particulars. Christ does not
say <em>while ye have the light</em>, but <cite>according as ye have
the light</cite>, that is, faith is to be exercised according
to the opportunity; he does not say <em>believe</em>,
a word which indicates an intellectual act, but
<cite>have faith</cite>, a word which indicates a spiritual
habit; he does not say <em>may be the children of light</em>,
as though a single act of belief perfected the
soul in sonship, but <cite>may become the children of
light</cite>, faith in such light as the soul possesses
being the way unto a final perfection in the
divine life. Faith is the evidence of things unseen
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 11:1</span>), that is, the power of the soul by
which it appreciates unseen moral qualities;
hence the divine qualities in Christ: hence, by
direct, immediate communion, the invisible spirit
of God. The direction here is the natural outcome
of the preceding warning, and may be paraphrased
thus: “As you have moral and spiritual
illumination, exercise faith toward it, apprehend,
appreciate, obey the sacred inner monitions
of your moral nature; so shall you be led constantly
into clearer light, and shall at last become
children of light, wholly possessed and
pervaded by it.” This of course includes the
exercise of faith in Christ according to the measure
in which he is revealed to the soul; but it
certainly is much more than a mere exhortation

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
to the Jews to believe in Jesus as the Messiah
while he remained in the flesh among them.
Both the warning against quenching this inner
light by disobedience, and the exhortation to
nourish it by appreciating and following it are
applicable to all men and for all time.—&#8203;<b>And
departed and hid himself from them.</b>
The very fact that these were among Christ’s
last words, and that immediately on uttering
them he departed into a concealment from which
apparently he did not issue till the time for his
passion, should have sufficed to prevent the
common but unspiritual interpretation controverted
above. “This was the farewell of Jesus
to Israel. He then retired and did not reappear
on the morrow. This time it was no mere cloud
which obscured the sun; the sun itself had set.”—(<cite>Godet.</cite>)
This statement fixes the time of this
incident; it was concurrent with his farewell
to Jerusalem, that is, on the same day with,
and probably just subsequent to the discourse
recorded in Matthew, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 23. In the discourses
of which that was the culmination, Christ plainly
foretold the destruction of Jerusalem and the
dispersion of the Jews, and indicated the calling
of the Gentiles (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 21:43; 23:37-39</span>). It may be
that those prophecies led to this application of
the Greeks for a more private interview with
the prophet who thus foretold the ingathering
of the Gentiles.</p>

<p><b>37-43.</b> These words are John’s comments on
the whole incident and teaching. The passages
from Isaiah (<span class="muchsmaller">6:9, 10; Isaiah 53:1</span>) illustrate Christ’s
warning, and Christ’s warning interprets Isaiah’s
prophecy. The blinding and hardening are here
attributed to God because they take place in
accordance with the divine law which Christ has
enunciated, namely, that disobedience to the
light quenches and destroys it. In Matthew
13:13-15, the Jews are represented as blinding
their own eyes, etc., because they have done so
by their disobedience. See notes on Matthew.
To those who recognize the authority of John,
his language here is conclusive that Isaiah spoke
as a prophet, and under divine inspiration.
Observe that Isaiah, though living seven centuries
before Christ, <em>saw his glory</em>, which the blinded
eyes of the Pharisees, though they were his contemporaries,
could not see. <em>Putting out of the
synagogue</em>, that is, excommunication, was in those
days a very serious matter. See <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch9_22">9:22</a>, note.
I make no attempt to follow other commentators
in a discussion here respecting the relation of
divine decrees and human free agency; that
belongs not to the commentator but to the metaphysician
and theologian. Taking the whole
passage together with its context, it seems to me
clear (against <cite>Alford</cite>) that the statement of John
<cite>Therefore they could not believe</cite>, refers not backwards
to the precedent prophecy of Isaiah, so
that the meaning is that they could not believe
“because it was otherwise ordained in the divine
counsels,” but forward to the subsequent prophecy
of Isaiah, so that the meaning is that they
could not believe because their eyes were blinded
and their hearts hardened. Either interpretation
is grammatically possible; this one makes
John’s comment germane to Christ’s discourse
respecting the light, and the effect of refusing
obedience to it; the other does not. An interpretation
which represents God as blinding the
eyes and hardening the heart, so as to prevent
the exercise of faith, and this in order that a
prophecy may be fulfilled, cannot be reconciled
with the divine righteousness, much less with
the divine infinite mercy.</p>

<p><b>44-46. But Jesus cried and said.</b> What
follows, to the end of the chapter, is not to be
regarded as a report of a further discourse by
Jesus, but as a summary furnished by John, of
his Lord’s previous discourses. This view is
required by the context, what follows being
closely connected with John’s previous comments,
by the structure of the discourse, which
is substantially a repetition of previously reported
discourses (see notes), and by the consideration
that, not only no time or place is indicated,
but that none is allowed, since it is expressly
asserted, immediately before, that Christ
departed and hid himself from the people
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch12_36">36</a></span>).
This view is taken by all the moderns (<cite>Alford</cite>,
<cite>Meyer</cite>, <cite>Godet</cite>, <cite>Luthardt</cite>). Bengel is hardly self-consistent.
In his Grammar he characterizes
this as “the peroration and recapitulation, in

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
John’s Gospel, of Christ’s public discourses;”
in his <cite>Harmony</cite> he suggests that Christ “spake
in the very act of departure, when he was now
at a considerable distance from the men; wherefore
he is said to have cried, in order, doubtless,
that those very persons with whom he had
spoken might hear;” an hypothesis which
Luthardt justly characterizes as artificial, unwarranted
by the Gospel account, and disagreeable.—&#8203;<b>He
that hath faith in me, hath
faith not in me but in him that sent me.</b>
<dfn>In</dfn> (<span lang="el">εἰς</span>) indicates the ultimate end or object of
the faith. The negative is not to be omitted or
reduced to a mere rhetorical expression, or read
as though it was equivalent to “hath not faith
in me alone.” True scriptural faith in Christ
does not <em>stop</em> with him, but finds in him the way
to the Father, the Spirit who is to be worshipped
in spirit as well as in truth, and whom no man
hath seen at any time. Hence Paul’s declaration,
“Yea, though we have seen Christ after the
flesh, yet now henceforth we know him no more.”
“Christ descended to us that he might unite us
to God. Until we have reached that point, we
are, as it were, in the middle of the course. We
imagine to ourselves but a half Christ, and a
mutilated Christ, if he do not lead us to God.”—(<cite>Calvin.</cite>)

that through faith in him we may be delivered

thus walk no longer in the darkness but in the

by a judge after trial, like a human
judgment, in which questions of law and fact
are involved. The book of each man’s life shall
be opened, and compared with the life of Christ
which is the pattern; and the life and teaching
of Christ will itself be the judgment; the comparison
will be conclusive; there will be no need
of investigation or of sentence. Hence every
man is judging and condemning himself, and
if unrepentant and unpardoned is condemned
already. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>

Simply putting him one side as of no practical

only by obeying them. See Matthew 13:23.—&#8203;<b>Because

are God-given. The Father is the reservoir from

of the external act of speaking.”—(<cite>Luthardt.</cite>)
To the same effect Meyer. The double expression
indicates that not only the <em>substance</em> but
also the <em>form</em> and <em>method of expression</em> of Christ’s
teaching are God-given.—&#8203;<b>And I know that
his commandment is life eternal.</b> It
has for its aim to produce life eternal; it has
for its subject-matter the conditions and nature
of life eternal; it is, in other words, the law of
the spiritual life. As science has to do with the
laws of the external, so Christianity with the
laws of the internal or spiritual world.

<hr class="tb">

<p><a id="Note_ch13"></a><span class="smcap">Preliminary Note.</span>—John alone of the Evangelists
gives no account of the institution of the
Lord’s Supper. But he alone gives us a report
of the last words of Christ, and his last prayer
with his disciples at the time of the institution
of the Supper. This report occupies chapters
13-17. This most sacred legacy which the Lord
has left to his disciples can never be interpreted
except by the heart which enters into the secret
place of the Most High. All that the commentator
can hope to do is to point out the significance
of the original, and the connection between
the various parts of this uninterpretable disclosure
of divine love. That the supper referred to
in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 2 here is the same described in Matthew
26:26-29, Mark 14:22-25, and Luke 22:19, 20,
I think is beyond question, and is indeed questioned
by few if any of the scholars except Lightfoot,
who endeavors to identify it with the supper
at which Mary anointed the feet of Jesus
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:1-16; John 12:2-8</span>). The time when the Last
Supper was celebrated, whether it was a true
Paschal feast or one which ante-dated and anticipated
it, is confessedly one of the most difficult
questions in Biblical chronology. If we had only
the Synoptical Gospels no one would doubt that
the Last Supper was the real Jewish Passover;
if we had only John, few would question that it
was previous to the Passover. This question I
have stated and discussed in the notes on Matthew
(note on Lord’s Supper, <abbr title="Volume One">Vol. I</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 286), and
to the discussion there refer the student. I have
no doubt, on a careful comparison of the four
accounts, that the four Evangelists refer to the
same supper, and that it was taken at the time
of and was for them the true Passover Supper.
In that case Christ’s act here receives new significance
from a comparison with the events recorded
by Luke (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
22:24-30 and notes</span>). The disciples sat
down to the meal without washing their feet,
after a hot and dusty walk. There was no servant
to perform the menial act for them; and
no one would volunteer to do it for the rest.
They quarreled as to which should have the pre-eminence
at the table. Christ said nothing,
waited till the quarrel was over and they had
taken their seats, and then rose from the table,
and girding himself as a servant, performed the
slave’s office in washing their feet. This was his
answer to their unseemly strife for the post of
honor at the table.</p>

<p><b>1. Now before the feast of the Passover.</b>
That is, immediately before; just as he
was about to sit down with his disciples to the
Paschal feast.—&#8203;<b>Jesus knew that his hour
was come.</b> In the full consciousness of his
approaching agony and passion. At the time
when above all others he needed that friends
should sustain him, he carried them in his heart;
their burdens were his own.—&#8203;<b>Having loved
his own which were in the world, he
loved them unto the end.</b> The end both in
time and in accomplishment; that is, he loved
them till death broke in on his life of love; he
loved them till love had finished its purpose in
them by their <span style="white-space:nowrap;">redemption—loved</span> them despite
their quarrels and contentions, that by love he
might brood and perfect the new life in them.
Properly the word (<span lang="el">τέλος, τελέω</span>) signifies not
merely <em>end</em> but also <em>completion</em>. So in 1 <abbr title="Thessalonians">Thess.</abbr>
2:16: “Wrath is come upon <i>them to the uttermost</i>”
(<span lang="el">εἰς τέλος</span>), <i>i. e.</i>, till it has accomplished its
purpose; and 1 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 1:5, “The end of the commandment
is love,” <i>i. e.</i>, love is the purpose
which the commandment is designed to accomplish.
The phrase <dfn>his own which were in the
world</dfn>, does not imply a limitation of love, as
though his love were for a limited number; but
it is only in his own that his love accomplishes

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
its designs. The language does imply that he
has others who are his own who are not in this
world; either the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> saints who had died in
hope of him, or inhabitants of some other world
who belong to him by the purchase of his love,
who are his own because redeemed by his blood
(<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 20:28; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 5:9</span>).</p>

he sat down to supper
again; nor does the
original require the
translation given to it
in our English version
(see <cite>Godet</cite>, <cite>Alford</cite>,
<cite>Meyer</cite>). Christ waited
till all contention was
over, all had taken
their seats and were
ready to begin the
meal, before he rose
to wash their feet.—&#8203;<b>The
devil having
already dropped
into the heart of
Judas Iscariot to
betray him.</b> The
devil was the sower,
but the soil was ready
to receive the seed. A
past suggestion is indicated.
The time
when and the way in
which this suggestion
was made is reported
by Matthew. It was at
the time when Christ
rebuked Judas for
complaining of the
anointing of her Lord
by Mary at Bethany
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
John <a href="#ch12_4">12:4-7</a> with <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
26:14</span>).—&#8203;<b>Jesus knowing
that the Father had given all things
into his hands.</b> See <abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 1:16. He acted in
the full consciousness of his divine power and
majesty. Humility consists not in a low estimate
of one’s powers, but in a willingness to use them
in a lowly service.—&#8203;<b>That he was come from
God and went to God.</b> This divine sense
shone out in him, so that it was seen and felt by
the apostles, perhaps most of all by John, who
was the most susceptible to such spiritual impressions.
For illustration of other times in
which the divinity of our Lord thus shone out
upon men, see <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 21:12; Mark 9:15; 10:32;
Luke 4:20, 30; John <a href="#ch7_44">7:44-46</a>; <a href="#ch18_6">18:6</a>.—&#8203;<b>He laid
aside his garments</b> (<span lang="el">ἱμάτια</span>). His outer mantle
or cloak (<span class="muchsmaller">see note on <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 24:18</span>). Then the inner
tunic was girded about the loins with a towel,
used partly in lieu of a girdle, partly to wipe the
feet. Thus Christ put
on the ordinary habit
of a servant for a servant’s
work. In this
feet-washing the feet
were not put into the
basin; the water was
poured over the feet
and then they were
wiped by the servant.
The accompanying cut,
from an original sketch
by Mr. A. L. Rawson,
shows the manner of
feet-washing, dress of
servant, etc., as observed
to-day in the
East.—&#8203;<b>And began
to wash the disciples’
feet.</b> Some of
the commentators suppose
that he came first
to Simon Peter (<cite>Alford</cite>);
but I see no
ground in the narrative
for this supposition,
which indeed
seems to me to be negatived
by the natural
reading of the original.
The objection of
Peter was an unexpected
episode and interruption.
So <cite>Meyer</cite>,
<cite>Chrysostom</cite>, and others.
Feet-washing did not rise to the dignity of a
ritualistic observance, except in connection with
the service of the sanctuary (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> 30:19-21</span>). It
held a high place, however, among the rites of
hospitality. “Immediately after a guest presented
himself at the tent door, it was usual to
offer the necessary materials for washing the
feet (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 18:4; 19:2; 24:32; 43:24; Judges 19:21</span>). It
was a yet more complimentary act betokening
equally humility and affection, if the host actually

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
performed the office for his guest (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Samuel">Sam.</abbr> 25:41;
Luke 7:38-49; John 13:5-14; 1 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 5:10</span>). Such a token
of hospitality is occasionally exhibited in the
East either by the host or by his deputy. The
feet were again washed (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Solomon">Sol.</abbr> Song 5:3</span>) before retiring
to bed.”—(<cite>Smith’s Bible Dictionary.</cite>)—&#8203;<b>Dost
thou wash my feet?</b> There is an emphasis
on the word <em>thou</em>. Dost thou, my Lord
and Master, act as my menial? “‘With those
hands,’ he saith, ‘with which thou hast opened
eyes, and cleansed lepers, and raised the dead!’”—(<cite>Chrysostom.</cite>)</p>

<p><b>7, 8. Thou knowest not now; but thou

merely that he would explain to them the significance
of his act, nor that they would understand
it and him in the future kingdom, though
both may be indicated. But spiritual truth is
only spiritually discerned (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 2:14, 15</span>), and the
most significant acts and teachings of Christ can
be comprehended only as the character is conformed
to his character (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 1:5-8</span>). The meaning
for Peter was that he must submit to Christ’s
authority and wait till time and spiritual development
enabled him to understand it; the meaning
for us is that if Christ is our Master, we must
accept in his word, his life and his providence
much that is now incomprehensible, and wait for
the future to make it plain. But if this implies a
limit to our present knowledge, it also promises
revelation hereafter. “Thou shalt know” assures
that all will be made plain by-and-by.—&#8203;<b>Thou
shalt never wash my feet.</b> Literally,
<cite>Thou shall not wash my feet to eternity</cite>. Pride in
Peter could not comprehend humility in Christ.
He thought the act, which was a manifestation
of the true glory of the Lord, dishonored him.
The same spirit in our day accounts the declaration
of the incarnation and of the atonement dishonorable
to God; it sees no glory in the humiliation
of love.—&#8203;<b>If I wash thee not, thou hast
no part with me.</b> The phrase <cite>to have part
with another</cite> signifies to share in his riches and
glory (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Joshua">Josh.</abbr> 22:25; 2 <abbr title="Samuel">Sam.</abbr> 20:1</span>). Here it includes
the idea of a partnership in the divine nature of
Christ (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 1:4</span>) as well as in the glory of Christ
which he has with the Father (<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch17_22">17:22-26</a>; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr>
20:6</span>). Washing was, it must be remembered, a
symbolical act, recognized so among the Jews,
and signifying purification from uncleanness.
Christ’s act in rising from the table and washing
the feet of the disciples was the severest rebuke
to their pride. See <a href="#Note_ch13"><abbr title="Preliminary">Prel.</abbr> Note</a>. Peter’s refusal
to be washed was a resistance to this rebuke.
That Christ’s language was understood by Peter
to signify a spiritual cleansing is indicated by his
reply.</p>

<p><b>9-12. Not my feet only, but also the
hands and the head.</b> This is generally regarded
as the expression of an impulsive revulsion
of feeling in Peter. “We have here the
same Peter who one minute rushes into the water,
and the next calls out ‘I perish’; who now
smites with the sword and now flees; who goes
even into the high priest’s palace and who denies
his Lord.”—(<cite>Godet.</cite>) I should rather regard it
as the language of argument and remonstrance
still continued. “If,” he says in effect, “this is
the reason of your washing, why stop with the
feet? why not go on and wash the rest, the
hands and the head?” <i>i. e.</i>, the face and neck.
To this argument Christ replies—&#8203;<b>He that is
bathed needeth not save to wash the feet,
but is wholly clean.</b> In the original there is
a distinction between <em>bathing</em> of the whole person
and <em>washing</em> of the feet which our English translation
ignores, but which is important. The
meaning is, As he that has been once bathed, and
so cleansed, needs only to wash what has become
soiled in his walk, so he who by the washing of
regeneration has been once cleansed of his sins
(<span class="muchsmaller">Titus 3:5</span>), needs only to come to Christ hereafter
for partial cleansing, <i>i. e.</i>, for forgiveness and
redemption from those sins which are in some
sense the product of his daily walk and life. He
does not need to come again and again for the
washing of regeneration, but only for the cleansing
of special faults. But even he who has been
bathed still needs to be constantly washed by
Christ (<span class="muchsmaller">1 John 1:8, 9</span>).—&#8203;<b>Ye are not all clean.</b>
Not all that seem to have come to Christ and to
have entered his service, are really cleansed by
him (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 7:21-23</span>).—&#8203;<b>He knew who should
betray him.</b> Among those whose feet were
washed was Judas. No love can touch or change
the heart resolutely set to do evil.—&#8203;<b>Know ye
what I have done to you?</b> That is, do you
comprehend the reason why it is done, and the
meaning of the action. The disciples are silent.
In the following verses Christ goes on to explain
its significance.</p>

on the fact that the phrase <em>the Lord</em> (<span lang="el">ὁ κύριος</span>) is
used in the Septuagint (Greek <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>) for Jehovah;
but it certainly is here more than a mere
title of respectful address; and the declaration
of Christ here, coupled with the declaration of
Matthew 23:8, One is your Master (Teacher), and
all ye are brethren, distinguishes him clearly from
his disciples, as not merely the chosen leader
among them, but having a divine authority over
them.—&#8203;<b>Ye say well; for I am.</b> The humble
office of feet-washing had been done by one who
was not only fully conscious of his supremacy,
but who in the very act claimed that supremacy.
This divine authority Christ never abdicated; his
divine consciousness he never lost.—&#8203;<b>If I then,
the Lord and the Master.</b> <em>The</em>Lord, not
merely <em>your</em>Lord. He might have been their
Lord and teacher by their selection; he was <em>the</em>
Lord and teacher by divine appointment, and by
virtue of his own character.—&#8203;<b>Ye also ought
to wash one another’s feet.</b> If we are to
interpret literally the commands of Christ, the
command of feet-washing as a perpetual observance
is even more explicit than that for the
observance of the Lord’s Supper. That is in
form a simple request: “Do this in remembrance
of me;” this is a request thrice repeated:
“Ye ought also to wash one another’s feet;”
“I have given you an example that ye should
do as I have done to you;” “If ye know these
things, happy are ye if ye do them.” Nevertheless
feet-washing has never been generally practised
by the Christian church. There is no indication
of its introduction into the apostolic
church. The only reference to it in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> is
1 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 5:10, and the probability is that the
reference there is to a rite of hospitality, not to
a religious or symbolical service. We first meet
with feet-washing in ecclesiastical history in the
fourth century. It was practised in connection
with baptism, on the catechumens in some parts
of the early church, especially in Gaul, possibly
in Africa and Spain. It is practised in some of
the Greek convents of to-day; by the <abbr title="Roman Catholic">R. C.</abbr>
church once a year on Maunday-Thursday, when
the Pope washes the feet of twelve pilgrims in
Rome; and by the Brethren (popularly known as
Dunkards), a sect of German Baptists chiefly
found in Pennsylvania; the Mennonites, a sect
of Dutch Anabaptists, chiefly confined also to
the eastern district of Pennsylvania in this country;
and possibly by some other minor sects.
With these exceptions, it has never been attempted
to maintain feet-washing as a religious
observance in the Christian church. This apparent
disregard of Christ’s seemingly explicit command
can be defended only on the general ground
that no ceremonial is of the essence of Christianity;
that the thing symbolized, not the symbol,
here the spirit of self-sacrifice and serving
love, not the form by which it is typified, is the
essential thing; that as eating the bread and
drinking the wine, not discerning the Lord’s
body (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 11:29</span>), is not a true observance of the
Lord’s Supper, so, on the other hand, the spirit
that is willing to serve others to their cleansing,
in humbleness of love, is a true observance of
the rite of feet-washing, though the rite itself is
disused. “It is not the act itself, but its moral
essence which, after his example, he enjoins upon
them to exercise. This moral essence, however,
consists not in lowly and ministering love generally,
in which Jesus by washing the feet of his
disciples desired to give them an example, but,
as <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch13_10">10</a> proves, in that ministering love which,
in all self-denial and humility, is active for the
moral purification and cleansing of others.”—(<cite>Meyer.</cite>)—&#8203;<b>I
have given you an example.</b>
It is the inward spirit of Christ, not the mere
outward act, that is an example for us to follow;
the cleansing love, not the girded garment and
the washing of feet, that is our pattern. For the
spiritual signification of this declaration, see
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch17_18">17:18</a>; 1 John 3:16.—&#8203;<b>The servant is not
greater</b>, etc. The repetition of this seemingly
self-evident truth indicates that Christ apprehended
for his followers that spiritual pride
which has been in the history of the church
almost their greatest danger. See <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch15_20">15:20</a>;
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 10:24; Luke 6:40.—&#8203;<b>If ye know these
things.</b> This language itself should have sufficed
to guard against the literalism which would
maintain feet-washing as a perpetual ceremonial.
Know what things? That he had washed their
feet? Of course they knew that. The meaning
clearly is, If ye understand the meaning of my
act, happy are ye if ye exemplify the same spirit
in your lives. <i lang="la">Per contra</i>, he that does not know,
that does not comprehend the spirit, is not

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
blessed in going through the mere form, and this
is equally true respecting all ceremonials. He
only is blessed in them who comprehends their
spiritual significance.</p>

<p><b>18-20. I speak not of you all.</b> The highest
service of Christ is serviceable only to those
who will receive it. The fact that Christ washed
the feet of Judas, and broke bread with him,
added to the blackness of his treachery and the
enormity of his guilt. The church, the Bible,
the Sabbath, the Lord’s Supper will rise up in
judgment against those who have participated
in them but have not imbibed the spirit of Christ
from them.—&#8203;<b>I know whom I have chosen.</b>
Couple this with the declaration of <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch15_16">15:16</a>,
“Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen
you.” The meaning is that Christ comprehended
the character of those whom he had selected for
his work; he was not deceived; and he is not
now deceived by false professions, however they
may deceive the church, the world, and even the
false professor himself. Why Christ should have
chosen Judas is one of the unsolved enigmas of
<abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> history.
We can see (1) that there was in
every apostle the same conflict between the
spiritual and the earthly nature which there was
in Judas Iscariot, though the final issue was so
different. (2) We cannot say that there was not
a possibility that it might have been different in
the case of Judas Iscariot. In other words, we
cannot say what are the limits to the freedom of
the will, what the possibility of good for the
evil soul, what the possibility of evil for him who
is preserved from it by accepting the grace of
God and so becoming his child. (3) The case of
Judas Iscariot has been full of warning to the
church in all ages; thus the development of his
character in the apostolate has been made a
means of service to mankind. His spirit was
that of the Pharisee; his position simply gave
that spirit an opportunity to exhibit itself.—&#8203;<b>But
that the Scripture might be fulfilled,
He that eateth bread with me hath lifted
up his heel against me, now I tell you
before it come.</b> Observe the difference in
the punctuation, from that of the English version.
The meaning is not, <em>I have chosen Judas
that the Scripture might be fulfilled</em>, for (1) this
interpretation, though that of Alford and Meyer,
requires us to supply or imagine a most important
hiatus in the text. Christ says nothing
about his choice of Judas; he lays emphasis on
the fact that all the twelve were chosen by him,
and therefore all were known to him. Nor is
the meaning, <em>I speak not of you all, in order that
the Scripture may be fulfilled</em>, which would make
Christ withhold a blessing for the purpose of
fulfilling a prophecy, an incredible interpretation.
But <em>that the Scripture</em>(which he parenthetically
quotes) <em>may be fulfilled</em>, <i>i. e.</i>, that the
disciples may recognize its fulfillment in the
events soon to take place, <cite>I now tell you before it
is come to pass</cite>. Thus the particle <em>but</em>(<span lang="el">ἀλλά</span>) connects
this sentence not with the declaration which
precedes, but with that which follows. The
Scripture is Psalm 41:9. The Psalm is clearly
not, in strictness of speech, a prophetic Psalm,
uttered as by the Messiah, for <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 4 contains a
confession of sin and a prayer for redemption.
“I said, Lord be merciful unto me and heal my
soul; for I have sinned against thee.” In that
Psalm, <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 9, “Yea mine own familiar friend
in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread,
hath lifted up his heel against me,” primarily
refers to some treachery displayed towards the
Psalmist, perhaps that of Ahithophel to David
(<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Samuel">Sam.</abbr> 15:31; 16:23</span>). But events as well as words
are prophetic; and the treachery of Ahithophel
towards David was itself a prophecy of the
treachery of Judas towards David’s greater Son.
To eat bread with another is, in the East, the
highest possible confirmation of a sacred covenant
with him. To lift up the heel is a figure
taken from the kick of a horse, who turns suddenly
upon one who has been feeding him. This
seems to me a better interpretation than that of
Canon Cook, who sees in it a figure taken from
the act of a conqueror putting his heel on the
neck of a prostrate foe.—&#8203;<b>That when it is
come to pass ye may believe that I am.</b>
The office of prophecy is here intimated. It is
not designed to give us in the present a definite
knowledge of future events. The most spiritually
minded among the Jews did not comprehend
the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> prophecy of Christ, and did
not understand the nature of his advent. It is
rather so to depict the future as (1) to awaken
hope or serve as a warning; and (2) to serve as
an evidence of the inspiration of the writer of
the book after the fulfillment of the prophecy
has demonstrated the prescience of the author.
On the phrase <cite>I am</cite>, see <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch8_58">8:58</a>, note.—&#8203;<b>He
that receiveth you</b>, etc. See <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 10:40,
note, where the same declaration is made in a
different connection. Here Christ, in order to encourage
the disciples, reiterates a principle with
which they were already familiar. Although,
he says, you are to serve in humble ways, as I

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
have served you, and although you will meet
with many a discouraging rebuff from without
and with treachery from among your own number,
yet you are not to forget that you are sent
into the world as your Master was sent into the
world, so that to receive you will be to receive
me.</p>

<p><b>21, 22.</b> An account of this prophecy of the
betrayal is given by all the Evangelists (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
26:21-25; Mark 14:18-21; Luke 22:21-23</span>). See notes on
Matthew. There is some difficulty in determining
the exact nature and order of the events, though
not more than we might expect in a comparison of
four independent accounts of circumstances involved
in so great confusion. The fullest account
is that of John. He alone mentions Judas’ departure
from the room. Matthew declares that
Christ replied directly in the affirmative to Judas’
question, Is it I? John, on the other hand,
asserts that no one in the room knew why Judas
went out (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:25 with
<abbr title="verses">vers.</abbr> <a href="#ch13_28">28</a>,
<a href="#ch13_29">29</a> here</span>). The
differences are not irreconcilable. Comparing
the four accounts, it would appear that Christ’s
declaration, “One of you shall betray me,” produced
the utmost consternation and excitement;
that all the disciples eagerly asked, “Is it I?”
“Is it I?” that Peter asked John to tell him
who it was, assuming that John knew, or could
ascertain (<span class="muchsmaller">see <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch13_24">24</a></span>); that at the same time Judas,
thunderstruck at the disclosure of his treachery,
which had been already planned (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:14-16</span>),
asked, perhaps somewhat tardily, the question,
“Is it I?” to hide his confusion; that Jesus
replied in an aside to him, “Thou hast said”
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:25</span>), a reply that in the confusion either
was not heard or was not heeded; that John,
turning toward Jesus so as to rest upon his
bosom (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch13_25">25</a></span>), asked who the betrayer should
be; that Jesus seemed to give the information,
but really refused to do so, in his reply, “He it
is to whom I shall give a sop” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch13_26">26</a></span>), since he
gave a sop in turn to all; so that when a moment
or two later Judas went out angered by
what he erroneously believed to be a public disclosure
of his treachery before all the disciples,
no one, not even John, knew why he had gone.
The question whether Judas was at the Lord’s
Supper has been greatly discussed. The question
seems to me of no practical importance;
and it is one impossible to answer with positiveness,
for John, who alone mentions his going
out, gives no account of the institution of the
Lord’s Supper. I believe, however, on a comparison
of the four accounts, that he was not at
the Last Supper, but went out immediately before
its institution. According to Matthew, the
prophecy of the betrayal preceded the institution
of the Supper; according to John, Judas
went out <em>immediately</em>after receiving the sop
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:25, 26 with <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch13_30">30</a> here</span>). And the explanation
of Christ’s course, as described by John,
appears to me to be his desire to have, in this
last sacred conference, only those who were
really his friends, and measurably in spiritual
sympathy with him. This I believe to be the
explanation of the direction to Judas in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch13_27">27</a>.
For an elaborate discussion of this question, see
Andrews’ <cite>Life of our Lord</cite>; for a fuller harmonic
account of the events, Lyman Abbott’s <cite>Jesus of
Nazareth</cite>.—&#8203;<b>He was troubled in spirit.</b> Compare
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch11_33">11:33</a>;
<a href="#ch12_27">12:27</a>. Our own experience
helps to interpret this, which Alford calls a
“mysterious troubling of spirit.” The presence
of an uncongenial soul often suffices to destroy
the sympathy of a sacred circle; the presence
of a known traitor might well have prevented
Christ from an outpouring of his soul in confidential
converse which renders the 14th, 15th, 16th
and 17th chapters of John the most sacred in the
Bible to the disciples of Christ.—&#8203;<b>One of you
shall betray me.</b> Christ had before foretold
his betrayal, <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 17:22; 20:18; 26:2, etc.,
but now for the first time he declares that he
should be betrayed by one of the twelve. No
wonder that they were startled.—&#8203;<b>The disciples
looked one on another doubting of
whom he spake.</b> And asking one another
(<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 22:23</span>) and eagerly asking Christ (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:22;
Mark 14:19</span>). Not one of them ventures to question
the truth of the Lord’s prophecy, and each
asks the personal question, “Is it I?” No one
accuses, even by implication, his neighbor. Is
not this a pattern for us in that self-examination
which should always precede our seasons of
sacred communion with our Lord (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 11:28</span>)?
an examination which should look forward rather
than backward; prepare for the future rather
than attempt to measure the past; and always
be a <em>self</em>examination.</p>

sacred and by him never-to-be-forgotten moment,
there first breaks from his lips this nameless,
and yet so expressive designation of himself.”—(<cite>Meyer.</cite>)
The phrase “whom Jesus loved”
occurs seven times in John’s Gospel; twice as a
designation of Martha, Mary and Lazarus (<span class="muchsmaller">John
<a href="#ch11_3">11:3</a>, <a href="#ch11_5">5</a></span>); five times as the designation of one of

It has been almost universally regarded as a
designation of John, the author of the Fourth
Gospel, who is accordingly known in the church
as the “beloved disciple,” though this designation
is not found in the Gospels themselves. The
main reasons for this opinion are two. (1) John

an unnamed disciple is frequently referred to

above</span>). It is not easy to conceive of any reason
why the author should leave unnamed any other
disciple, but it is not at all strange that he should
use a circumlocution to designate himself.
(2) His character, so far as we know it, corresponds
with his designation as the “beloved disciple.”
See <a href="#Page_3">Introduction</a>. It has been, indeed,
objected that there is a certain appearance of
egotism in his singling himself out as the disciple
whom Jesus loved, a designation never given
to him by either of the other Evangelists. The
reply to this is, or at least may be, that the
designation was employed by John, not because
he desired in any sense to claim or imply a
supremacy above the other disciples, but because
the wonder of his life was that Jesus should
love such an one as he, and by love should transform
him. All facts in his life sink into insignificance
in his thought by the side of this fact,
that he was beloved of Jesus, chosen to be the
witness of his transfiguration, his nearest companion
at the Last Supper, the sympathizing
sharer in his agony at Gethsemane, and the
guardian of his mother after the death of her
son (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 17:1; 26:37;

Peter therefore beckoned to him and
said, Tell us who it is.</b> This is the true
reading, adopted by all critics, Alford, Meyer,
Lachmann, Tischendorf, etc. The expression
has been altered to that of the Received Text in
order to adapt Peter’s question to John’s account
as described in the next verse. The Sinaitic
manuscript has the Received Text, “That he
should ask who it should be,” as an explanatory
gloss or comment alongside the original expression,
“Tell who it is.” Peter seems to have
assumed that John would know. Possibly in
the general tumult the latter preserved his composure,
and conscious of his own supreme love
for his Lord, did not join in the general exclamation,
“Is it I?”—&#8203;<b>He then throwing himself
back on Jesus’ breast.</b> (See Robinson’s
<cite>Lexicon</cite>, <span lang="el">ἐπιπίπτω</span>.) The language of the English
version is inadequate and incorrect, since it
merely repeats the phrase used in verse <a href="#ch13_23">23</a>, as
though to identify the person; whereas the
original implies an action on John’s part, by
which he turned and rested more closely than
before on Christ’s bosom. He had before been
reclining next to Jesus in the manner indicated
in the illustration on page 282 of <abbr title="Volume One">Vol. I</abbr> of this
Commentary. He now raises himself, and turns
so as to rest upon Jesus’ breast and whisper in
his ear. The graphic details of this entire narrative
are unmistakably those of an eye-witness.</p>

</div>

<p><b>26. He it is to whom I shall give a sop.</b>
This reply, and Christ’s accompanying action, is
generally regarded as a designation, at least to
John, of the traitor. I think this is a mistake.
It is no uncommon act in an Eastern meal for
the host, as a special act of consideration, to dip
a piece of bread or meat in the sauce or gravy
and pass it to a special guest, or even put it into
his mouth. In the Passover feast, the head of
the house habitually took from the passover
cake a piece, dipped it in the sauce of bitter
herbs (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> 12:8</span>), and passed it in turn to the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
persons at the table. Christ’s answer to John,
therefore, was simply a more solemn reiteration
of the declaration of <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch13_18">18</a>, “He that eateth
bread with me hath lifted up the heel against
me.” He dipped the piece of bread in the
sauce, and passed it to the disciples in turn.
In doing so he gave it first to Judas. John may
have understood the significance of the act; but
it is plain from <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch13_28">28</a> that none of the others
at the table did so. I should rather regard the
act as a new endeavor on the part of Christ by
love to turn Judas from his evil purpose. He
has answered without designating him. He now
endeavors to draw him to himself by singling
him out for a manifestation of special love. In
the same spirit are the last words he addressed
to the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">apostate—words</span> not of angry rebuke, but
of pathetic remonstrance: “Friend, wherefore
art thou come? Betrayest thou the Son of man

<p><b>27-30. Satan entered into him.</b> It is a
mistaken literalism which interprets this phrase
as indicating that Judas was from this time
demoniacally possessed. Nor, on the other hand,
is it to be regarded as a merely figurative expression,
indicating that Judas gave himself up
wholly and unreservedly to evil. The <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
teaching assumes the existence of evil spirits
and their influence over human beings (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 13:19,
38; Luke 4:6; 22:31; John <a href="#ch14_30">14:30</a>;
Acts 5:3; 26:18; 2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr>
2:11; <abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 2:2; 4:27;
6:11; 2 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 2:26; Jas. 4:7;
1 John 3:8; 5:18</span>), and the language here is in
accordance with its spiritual philosophy. It
simply indicates that Judas’ determined resistance
to the warning words and the winning love
of Christ gave to the Evil One a new advantage
and influence over him. The solemn lesson for
us is that, as every faithful performance of
known duty opens our heart to the incoming of
God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_23">14:23</a></span>), so every determined resistance of
sacred influences and every persistence in sin,
opens our nature to the incoming of unknown
but tremendous Satanic influences. It has before
been said of Judas that Satan entered into him
(<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 22:3</span>). There is growth in the kingdom of
darkness as in that of light. As God enters by
successive manifestations of himself into his
saints, so Satan into those that give themselves
up to him.—&#8203;<b>That thou doest, do quickly.</b>
Literally, <dfn>more quickly</dfn> (<span lang="el">τάχιον</span>); <i>i. e.</i>, hasten it.
This is not to be regarded as merely permission,
as Adam Clarke: “What thou art determined
to do, and I to permit, do directly; delay not; I
am ready;” nor yet as mandatory, and involving
the utterance of a divine decree, as Alford:
“The course of sinful action is presupposed,
and the command to go on is but the echo of
that mysterious appointment by which the sinner
in the exercise of his own corrupted will
becomes the instrument of the purposes of God;”
but as the expression of Christ’s desire to be rid
of the oppressive proximity of the traitor, as
Ambrose and Tholuck. He sees that the purpose
of Judas is fully fixed; he will not have
him remain there, contaminating the very atmosphere,
and increasing his own guilt by his dissembling.
We are apt to judge men by the
external act; no wonder then that Christ has
been accused of pushing Judas over the precipice.
But he who judged by the heart, and
accounted him already a murderer who has murder
in his heart (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:22</span>), would not have the
resolute apostate increase the guilt of betrayal
by that of hypocrisy. Moreover, Christ wishes
the few minutes that remain for sacred converse
with his faithful friends; and that he cannot
have in the presence of the hypocrite and traitor.
So he bids him begone. “Play the hypocrite
here no longer,” he says to him; “but since you
are determined on treason, go on and consummate
it.”—&#8203;<b>Now no one at the table knew
why he thus spake to him.</b> Perhaps the
writer himself, that is John, is to be excepted
from this general statement. This is the opinion
of most of the commentators. Yet it is not at
all impossible that not even John comprehended
the significance of Christ’s act in handing the
sop to Judas first of the disciples.—&#8203;<b>Because
Judas had the bag.</b> Being treasurer of the
little band. See <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch12_6">12:6</a>, note.—&#8203;<b>Buy those
things we have need of against the feast.</b>
From this phrase it is argued by Alford and
Meyer that the supper at which our Lord was
sitting with his disciples could not have been the
Passover Supper. “Had it been the night of
the Passover, the next day being hallowed as a
Sabbath, nothing could have been bought.”—(<cite>Alford.</cite>)
But Tholuck has shown that according
to Rabbinical rules a purchase could be made
on the Sabbath by leaving a pledge and afterwards
settling the account. The feast lasted for
the week; therefore the disciples may well have
supposed that a purchase for a later period of
the feast was contemplated. And the fact that
Christ hastened Judas would have been better
understood if the following day was the Sabbath,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
when the shops would be shut.—&#8203;<b>Or that he
should give something to the poor.</b> Evidently
this little band carried out the precepts
of Christian love which their Master inculcated.
Small as was their store, it is clear that out of it
they were accustomed to bestow alms on the more
needy.—&#8203;<b>Went out immediately.</b> There was
then, clearly, no opportunity for the institution
of the Lord’s Supper during his presence, unless
it was instituted either before the feet-washing,
which the order of the narrative and its probable
connection with the contest about places described
in Luke, makes exceedingly improbable,
or between verses <a href="#ch13_20">20</a> and <a href="#ch13_21">21</a>, which seems from
the connection to be also very improbable. I
believe it is to be regarded as occurring between
the departure of Judas and the beginning of
Christ’s discourse in <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#Note_ch14">14</a>. Matthew and Mark
both put it immediately after the prophecy of
the betrayal; Luke before.—&#8203;<b>And it was
night.</b> A graphic addition to the picture; significant
of the fact that the narration is that of
an eye-witness in whose memory every detail
was indelibly impressed; and suggestive of the
darkness of the deed about to be consummated,
and of the traitor’s heart. It is always night
when a deed of determined sin is entered upon.
“The night which this miserable wretch has in
his heart is, without comparison, blacker and
darker than that which he chooses for his work
of darkness.”—(<cite>Quesnel.</cite>)</p>

<p><b>31, 32. When he was gone out Jesus
said.</b> The departure of Judas is a relief. Now
for the first time Christ can speak freely, unoppressed
by the presence of a traitor and a hypocrite.—&#8203;<b>Now
has the Son of man been
glorified, and God has been glorified in
him</b> (<span lang="el">ὲδοξάσθη</span>, aorist). <b>If God has been
glorified in him, God also shall glorify
him in himself, and shall straightway
glorify him.</b> The significance of this utterance
has been, it seems to me, misapprehended by the
commentators, from a failure to consider the
mental attitude and expectation of the disciples.
The phrase <cite>Son of man</cite> was a common Jewish
designation of the Messiah, borrowed from
Daniel, and would have been so understood by
the disciples (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 10:23, note</span>). They had come
up to Jerusalem anticipating the coronation of
the Messiah as King of the Jews. They had entered
Jerusalem in triumph, hailing him as such
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 21:1-11</span>). Two of the disciples on the way
had come to him privately for the best offices
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 20:20, 21</span>). The twelve even had quarreled
for pre-eminence as they were sitting down at
the table (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 22:24</span>). The immediate object of
Christ in the discourse which follows is to prepare
them for the terrible revulsion of feeling,
the shock of disappointment and despair which
the morrow had in store for them. He begins,
therefore, with the declaration that the glory of
the Messiah is an already accomplished fact. He
has been glorified; by his incarnation, his life
of loving self-sacrifice, his patience, courage,
fidelity, love; and in his life and character, God
has been glorified. The disciples have beheld
already the glory of the only begotten of the
Father, full of grace and truth
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch1_14">1:14</a></span>). Then
he adds a prophecy of further glory; not that of
the death; not that of the resurrection; not that
of the ascension; but that of being again one
with the Father.—&#8203;The Father shall glorify him,
<em>in himself</em>. He foresees and foretells the answer
to be given to the prayer “Glorify thou me, <em>with
thine own self</em>, with the glory which I had with
thee before the world was” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_5">17:5</a></span>). And for
this there is to be no waiting; no delay for an
earthly coronation. There must be a long interval
of redeeming work before he can see of the
travail of his soul and be satisfied; before every
knee will bow and every tongue confess him
Lord; before he can reign King of kings and
Lord of lords; but for this the Father will not
wait. Immediately that his work of suffering
and self-sacrifice is over, he will return to the
bosom of the Father, to share with him the glory
which he had from the foundation of the world.</p>

<p><b>33-35. Little children.</b> The only place
where this phrase is used by Christ in addressing
his disciples. But we find it more frequently in
the Epistles of Paul (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 4:14, 17; 2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 6:13;
1 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 1:2; 2 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 2:1</span>). It “affectingly expresses
his, not only brotherly, but fatherly love (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr>
9:6</span>) for his own, and at the same time their
immature and weak state, now about to be left
without him.”—(<cite>Alford.</cite>)—<b>And as I said to
the Jews</b> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch8_21">8:21</a></span>), <b>Whither I go ye cannot
come, so now I say to you.</b> But though
they could not go to him, he would come to
them, and abide with them (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_18">14:18</a>, <a href="#ch14_23">23</a></span>). The
longing to depart and be with Christ is to be
gratified only by our having Christ with us, until

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
the time of final departure comes. It is one
thing to desire him here, willing to fill up the
measure of his suffering in our own life, if he is
in us and with us (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 12:10</span>); it is another and
very different thing to desire to depart and be
with him that we may escape the suffering. The
first is a Christian longing; not so the second.—&#8203;<b>A
new commandment I give unto you,
That ye love one another; as I have
loved you, that ye also love one another.</b>
The commandment to love is not new (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Leviticus">Lev.</abbr> 19:18</span>).
But Christ’s life gives to it a new interpretation
and makes it new. Love has, ever since the life
and death of Christ, taken on a new signification.
To forgive is now to bless those that curse us,
and do good to those that despitefully use us.
The language here is parallel to and interpreted
by <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch17_18">17:18</a>,
“As thou (Father) hast sent me
into the world, even so have I also sent them
into the world.” It is the interpretation of the
direction, “Follow me.” We are to be followers
of his spirit, especially of his love. This general
definition includes other special definitions that
have been given, <i>e. g.</i>, it is new because with
it there comes a new motive power, the love
of Christ experienced in the heart, which becomes
in turn the fountain of love to all others
(<cite>Meyer</cite>); a renewed commandment, rejuvenated,
cleansed of the overlay of ceremonialism which
Pharisaism had put upon it (<cite>Calvin</cite>); new to the
disciples, unexpected by them, who were looking
for a new disclosure of divine glory in a very
different direction (<cite>Semler</cite> quoted in <cite>Meyer</cite>);
new because love is ever new, never can grow
old (<cite>Olshausen</cite>); new because the law of the new
covenant, the firstfruits of the Spirit in the new
dispensation (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 5:22</span>).
It is notable how this
one law of love runs through and colors all this
last sacred discourse of Jesus. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch14_15">14:15</a>,

are words full of the comfort and inspiration
and exaltation of love.—&#8203;<b>By this shall all men
know that ye are my disciples.</b> Not by
professions, or creeds, or ceremonials, or religious
services, but by love one towards another.
Love is the Christian water-mark, the Christian

<p><a id="Note_ch14"></a><span class="smcap">Preliminary Note.</span>—The 14th, 15th, 16th and
17th chapters of John are the Holy of Holies of
the Bible. Christ is about to depart from his
disciples; the cloud of the coming trouble casts
its shadow on their hearts; he sees clearly, they
feel vaguely the impending tragedy. They are
to behold their Master spit upon, abused, execrated;
they are to see him suffering the tortures
of a lingering death upon the cross; they are to
be utterly unable to interfere for his succor or
even for his relief; they are to see all the hopes
which they had built on him extinguished in his
death. It is that he may prepare them for this
experience, that he may prepare his disciples
throughout all time (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_20">17:20</a></span>) for similar experiences
of world-sorrow (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch16_33">16:33</a></span>), and that he
may point out to them and to the church universal
the source of their hope, their peace, their
joy, and their <span style="white-space:nowrap;">life—moral</span> and <span style="white-space:nowrap;">spiritual—that</span>
he speaks to the twelve, and through them to
his discipleship in all ages, in these chapters,
and finally offers for them and for us that prayer
which we may well accept as the disclosure of
his eternal intercession for his followers. The
discourse is sympathetic, not philosophical or
critical; it is addressed to sympathetic friends,
not to a cold or critical audience; and it is to be
interpreted rather by the sympathies and the spiritual
experience than by a philosophical analysis.
It sets forth the source of all comfort, strength,
guidance and spiritual well-being in the truth of
the direct personal presence of a seemingly absent
but really present, a seemingly slain but
really living, a seemingly defeated but really victorious
Lord and Master. This truth appears
and reappears in various forms in these chapters,
like the theme in a sublime symphony. Now it
is plainly stated, “I will come to you”
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_18">14:18</a></span>);

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
now it is interpreted by a metaphor, “Ye are the
vine, I am the branches” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch15_5">15:5</a></span>); now it is a
promise of the Spirit’s presence, now of Christ’s,
now of the Father’s (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_16">14:16</a>, <a href="#ch14_18">18</a>,
<a href="#ch14_21">21</a>, <a href="#ch14_23">23</a></span>); now the
disciples are bid to turn their thoughts toward
this spiritual presence, this Divine Immanence,
for their own sake (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch16_7">16:7</a></span>), now they are appealed
to by the love they bear the Master
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_28">14:28</a></span>). The conditions of this personal experience
of the unseen spiritual presence of their
God and Saviour is declared to be obedience in
the daily life to the law of love (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_21">14:21</a>, <a href="#ch14_23">23</a>; <a href="#ch15_10">15:10</a></span>);
the result is declared to be a constant growth in
the knowledge of divine truth (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_26">14:26</a>; <a href="#ch16_12">16:12</a>, <a href="#ch16_13">13</a></span>);
a sacred peace and joy (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_27">14:27</a>; <a href="#ch15_11">15:11</a></span>);
a supernatural
strength in sorrow (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch16_20">16:20-22</a></span>). These
truths are not logically arranged; the structure
of the discourse is not that of a sermon, but that
of a confidential conversation, in which in different
forms the same essential truth is repeated
and re-repeated, because the heart is so full that
a single utterance does not suffice, and the truth
is so transcendent that no logical statement is
adequate. After the conversation is closed and
the disciples rise to depart, Christ recurs to the
theme in a new form, and continues the discourse,
while the disciples wait standing for a
new signal to go out (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_31">14:31</a>; <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 15, <a href="#Note_ch15"><abbr title="Preliminary">Prel.</abbr> Note</a></span>);
and, finally, when for a second time he draws his
discourse to a close, he re-embodies the same
consolatory and inspiring truth in a prayer,
breathing the aspiration that the reward and
secret and source of his own power may be given
to his disciples, sent into the world to complete
the mission which he has but inaugurated (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_18">17:18</a></span>).
Thus these chapters of John contain a disclosure
of the very heart of Christianity, the personal
knowledge of a living God by direct communion
with him, as a teacher, a comforter, an
inspirer, the one and only true source of faith,
hope, love. The commentator must point out
the connection of the verses and the meaning of
the words; his work must be in a measure critical
and cold; but only the devout heart, which
knows by experience that love of Christ which
passes the knowledge of the intellect, can interpret
the spiritual meaning of the truth, since
the condition of understanding it is not a critical
knowledge of words or an intellectual apprehension
of theology, but a love for Christ that keeps
Christ’s words, that recognizes Christ’s mission
to be also the mission of the Christian, and that
abides in Christ in the spirit that it may follow
Christ in the life. Without this spirit the student
in vain addresses himself to the study of
this “wisdom of God in a mystery,” hidden
except to the soul to whom God hath revealed
it by his Spirit (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 2:7-10</span>).</p>

<p><b>1-3. Let not your heart be troubled.</b>
In this hour of unparalleled sorrow, with Gethsemane,
the betrayal, the denial, the mock trials
and the crucifixion full in view, Christ thinks not
of himself, but of his disciples. He does not
seek comfort, but imparts it. We may well
imagine a momentary silence after the prophecy
of the preceding verses. The disappointment of
the Judaic expectation of temporal and political
deliverance, the prophecy of treason, the sudden
and unexpected departure of Judas, the
prophecy of Peter’s denial, and of the abandonment
of their Lord by the other disciples, have
all tended to sober and sadden them.—&#8203;<b>Ye have
faith in God, have faith also in me.</b> The
forms of the indicative and the imperative are the
same (<span lang="el">πιστεύετε</span>). Some critics read both verbs
indicative, <cite>Ye have faith in God, ye have faith also
in me</cite>; some both imperative; treating both as
an exhortation, <cite>Have faith in God; have faith
also in me</cite>; and some, as our English version,
which makes the statement of the first clause
the ground of the exhortation of the second
clause, <cite>Ye have faith in God, have faith also in me</cite>.
Either rendering is grammatically legitimate;
the latter seems to me preferable. As Jews they
had faith in the one only true and living God;
a faith which, in the experience of patriarchs
and prophets, trial and trouble had not been able
to shake (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Habakkuk">Hab.</abbr> 3:17, 18</span>). Christ urges them to a
like faith in him, a faith strong enough to survive
the brief though terrible separation of death.
Theism is the foundation of Christianity; faith
in one only living and true God precedes and prepares
the way for faith in Christ his Son, the
living and true way to the Father. To believe
in him is not to believe anything about him, nor
merely to trust in him, but to have such a spiritual
apprehension of his character, that when he
is crucified the disciples shall not lose their confidence
in him as the Messiah. He warns them
against that doubt which augmented and intensified
their distress when they saw him whom
they had trusted should have redeemed Israel
put to an open shame and a cruel death (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 24:21</span>).
They were trusting in themselves. Peter’s

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
declaration, “I will lay down my life for thy
sake,” expressed the common confidence of all
(<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 14:31</span>). Christ first demolished this false
confidence, then seeks to build up a new and
better confidence in himself.—&#8203;<b>In my Father’s
house are many dwelling-places.</b> The
phrase “my Father’s house” is generally regarded
as a circumlocution for heaven; Christ’s
declaration as tantamount to the general statement
that in heaven there is room enough for
them all (<cite>Alford</cite>, <cite>Meyer</cite>, etc.); and in support of
this view such <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>
passages as <abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 23:13, 14;
Isaiah 63:15, are quoted, which refer to the
heavens as God’s habitation. I would rather
regard the universe as God’s house according to
the spirit of Isaiah 66:1, “Heaven is my throne,
and earth is my footstool,” and the declaration
that in it are many dwelling-places, as a new
light thrown upon the abode of the dead who
die in Christ Jesus. The ancients regarded
Hades, or the abode of the dead, a deep and
dark abode in the under-world, fastened with
gates and bars, a ghostly abode, a prison-house
of the disembodied (<span class="muchsmaller">Job 10:21, 22; 11:8; <abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 88:6;
89:48; <abbr title="Eccclesiasticus">Eccles.</abbr> 9:4; <abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 5:14; 14:9-20, 38:10; <abbr title="Ezekiel">Ezek.</abbr> 31:17;
32:21</span>). The <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> thought of death and the
abode of the dead was hardly more hopeful than
that of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Homer
makes the dead Achilles declare:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent22">“I would be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A laborer on earth and serve for hire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some man of mean estate, who makes scant cheer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rather than reign over all who have gone down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To death.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Parallel to this, in some respects more gloomy,
were the ancient Hebrews’ thoughts of Hades.
Dying was bidding farewell to God. “Wilt thou
show wonders to the dead? Shall the dead arise
and praise thee? *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Shall thy righteousness be
known in the land of forgetfulness?” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 88:10-12</span>).
“In death there is no remembrance of thee” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr>
6:5</span>). <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> Isaiah, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 38, and Job, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 14. The
hope of better things is but an occasional gleam
in a night of great darkness and almost despair.
See Job 10:21, 22; <abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 89:45-49; <abbr title="Eccclesiasticus">Eccles.</abbr> 9:4;
Isaiah 5:14, 15; 14:9-20; <abbr title="Ezekiel">Ezek.</abbr> 31:16, 17; and
especially Isaiah, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 38, and Job, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 14. In
contrast with this gloomy view of death is that
of the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>, the germ of which is afforded by
Christ’s declaration here, which may be paraphrased
thus: “The earth is not the only abode
of God’s children; in my Father’s house (the
universe) are many dwelling-places for them;
and I, in leaving you, am not going to the dark
abode of the voiceless dead, but to prepare for
you a place, and to return again to take you to
myself, that you may witness and share the glory
which I have with the Father.” Out of this
declaration grows, as a fruitful tree out of a
seed, the whole of the discourse contained in this
and the two following chapters. Out of it grows,
too, the Christian’s conception of and experience
in death. See for example 2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 5:1-4. It
should be added that the word <cite>house</cite> (<span lang="el">οἰκία</span>) is
never used in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> as a designation of
heaven, but with the analogous word (<span lang="el">οἷκος</span>) <dfn>household</dfn>,
is used of the world (<span class="muchsmaller">John
<a href="#ch8_35">8:35</a></span>), the temple
(<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch2_16">2:16</a></span>), and the whole kingdom of God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr>
3:2-6</span>); so that <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> usage confirms the interpretation
here given. The word rendered <em>mansions</em>
(<span lang="el">μονή</span>) occurs nowhere else in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>, but is
derived from a verb (<span lang="el">μένω</span>) signifying to <dfn>abide</dfn>,
and here unquestionably indicates not a <em>mansion</em>,
but simply a permanent dwelling-place. This
was indeed the original meaning of the English
word mansion (<abbr title="French">Fr.</abbr> <i lang="fr">maison</i>).—&#8203;<b>If not, would I
have told you that I go to prepare a place
for you?</b> The reference is to some previous
statement not preserved in our Gospels. The
argument is this: I could not have assured you,
as I have done, that I am going to prepare a
place for you, if the place of the dead were the
dark abode which you have imagined it to be.
This, which is the interpretation of the French
translation, seems to me, notwithstanding the
objection of the modern writers (<cite>Meyer</cite>, <cite>Godet</cite>,
<cite>Tholuck</cite>, etc.), better than the construction of
our English version, though either is grammatically
admissible. If we take the other construction,
the connection is as Godet gives it: “If
our separation was to be an eternal one, I would
have forewarned you; I would not have waited
for this last moment to declare it unto you.”—&#8203;<b>And
if I go and prepare a place for you.</b>
The implication of this entire passage is not
merely “heaven large enough for all,” but a
heaven with various provisions for various natures.
In the Father’s house is not merely a
large mansion, but <em>many</em>mansions; and there is
prepared a place not merely for all but for <em>you</em>,
a personal preparation in glory <em>for</em>each child as
by grace <em>in</em>each child; a room, a house for each
nature adapted to its needs. But how does
Christ <em>prepare</em>a place for us? To that question
revelation makes no answer. We can only say
that redemption did not end with Christ’s death,
that he is still carrying on his work of redeeming
love for us as well as in us. In every death of a
friend he lays up treasure in heaven for us; those
that have gone before and entered into their rest,
and await our coming, are a part of this divine
preparation. The sorrow here is a part of the
preparation of unmeasured joy hereafter.—&#8203;<b>I
will come again and receive you unto
myself.</b> In order to understand this, we must
bear in mind what Stier well calls the perspective
of prophecy. “The coming again of the Lord
is not one single <span style="white-space:nowrap;">act—as</span> his resurrection, or the
descent of the Spirit, or his second personal

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
advent, or the final coming in <span style="white-space:nowrap;">judgment—but</span>
the combination of all these, the result of which
shall be his taking his people to himself to be
where he is. This coming is begun (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_18">18</a></span>) in his
resurrection; carried on (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_23">23</a></span>) in the spiritual
life (<span class="muchsmaller">see also <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch16_22">16:22</a>, etc.</span>), the making them ready
for the place prepared; further advanced when
each by death is fetched away to be with him
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 1:23</span>); fully completed at His coming in
glory when they shall be forever with Him
(<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Thessalonians">Thess.</abbr> 4:17</span>) in the perfected resurrection state.”—(<cite>Alford.</cite>)—<b>That.</b>
<em>In order that</em>(<span lang="el">ἵνα</span>). The
going, the preparing, the returning are all for
the sake of them, his disciples.—&#8203;<b>Where I am
there ye may be also.</b> Death is no longer
“farewell to God;” it is going home to be forever
with the Lord (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_24">17:24</a>; <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 1:23; 1 <abbr title="Thessalonians">Thess.</abbr> 4:17</span>).</p>

<p><b>4, 5. And whither I go</b> (ye know and) <b>the
way ye know</b>. There is some doubt as to the
reading; most critics (<cite>Meyer</cite>, <cite>Alford</cite>, <cite>Tischendorf</cite>,
<cite>Lachmann</cite>) either omit or doubt the words
I put in brackets. But their omission obscures
without changing the sense; the meaning is undoubtedly
that conveyed by our Received Version.
While in form a statement, it is in fact an
inquiry; its object is to provoke questioning, as it
does from Thomas. Whither he goes is to the
Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch20_17">20:17</a></span>); the way he goes is the way of
death and resurrection, already foretold them
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
16:21; 17:22, 23; 20:17-19</span>).—&#8203;<b>Thomas saith
unto him, We know not</b>, etc. On the character
of Thomas, see <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch20_26">20:26</a>. The few indications
of his character afforded by the Gospels
(<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch11_16">11:16</a>;
<a href="#ch20_24">20:24-29</a></span>) show him to have possessed
an affectionate but unimaginative nature, desiring
much, hoping little, and easily given to despair.
Such a nature takes nothing for granted;
it wants every statement explained, nothing left
to the imagination, nothing to the interpretation
of the future. “The heavenly <em>whither</em>, however
distinctly Jesus had already designated it,
Thomas did not yet know clearly how to combine
with his circle of Messianic ideas; but he
desired to arrive at clearness.”—(<cite>Meyer.</cite>)</p>

<p><b>6, 7. Jesus saith unto him, I am the

directly responsive to the implied question of
Thomas. That is theoretical; this is practical.
The disciples desire to understand the way by
which Christ is to depart, and the place to which
he is going; Christ’s answer points out the way in
and by which the disciple can follow his Lord and
be with him where he is. There is here, therefore,
not merely a play upon the word “way,”
though Christ uses it in one sense in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_4">4</a> and
in a different sense in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_6">6</a>; but the same word
is used to turn the thoughts of the inquirer from
a purely theoretical question about Christ to a
practical truth concerning himself. It was always
the habit of Christ to answer questions in
theoretical theology by directions helpful to the
spiritual life (<span class="muchsmaller">see <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_22">22-24</a>; <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch3_4">3:4-6</a>;
<a href="#ch4_19">4:19-24</a></span>). The
phrase, <cite>I am the way, the truth, and the life</cite>, may
be interpreted, according to Lightfoot, as a Hebraism
equivalent to the true and living way;
but it is better to take the two latter phrases as
explanations of the former. Christ is the way
unto the Father, not because he points out the
way, but because he is the truth concerning the
Father, and possesses in himself the divine life,
and has power to impart it to us. He does not
merely reveal the truth; he <em>is</em> the truth; the
truth incarnated in a living form; the truth
of God, whom he manifests to the world (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
11:27; John <a href="#ch1_1">1:1</a>, <a href="#ch1_2">2</a>,
<a href="#ch1_14">14</a>; 10:30; <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:6; <abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 2:9; <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr>
1:13</span>), and the truth of life, which he illustrates
more forcibly by his example than by his words,
so that all his precepts are summed up in the
one command, “Follow me.” He is the life,
having life in himself (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch5_26">5:26</a></span>), imparting it to
others (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch10_10">10:10</a></span>), and so giving them power to
become sons of God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_12">1:12</a></span>) by the possession
of that divine life without which no man can
ever see God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch3_3">3:3</a>; <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 12:14</span>). To come to the
Father by Christ as the way is not, then, merely
to accept him as an inspired teacher respecting
the Father, nor merely as an atoning sacrifice,
whose blood cleanses away the sins which intervene
between the soul and the Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 10:20</span>);
it is to be conformed to him as to the truth, and
to be made partaker of his life (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 3:8-14</span>).—&#8203;<b>No
one cometh to the Father but by me.</b> He
now says “to the Father,” not to the Father’s
house, because, as Godet well says, “It is not in
heaven that we are to find God, but in God that
we are to find heaven.” By <em>me</em> is equivalent to,
by me as the way, the truth, and the life. This
does not necessarily require a knowledge of,
still less a correct theological opinion concerning
Christ. The conception of God’s character may
be really derived from Christ’s teaching, the life
may be conformed to Christ’s example, and the
soul may be partaker of his spirit, and yet the
individual may be unconscious of the source
from which he has derived his knowledge of
God, his ideal of life, and his inspiration. This
declaration is inclusive rather than exclusive; it
is equivalent to that of <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_9">1:9</a> (<span class="muchsmaller">see note there</span>),

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
“That was the true Light which lighteth every
man that cometh into the world.” All spiritual
life comes through Christ, but not necessarily
through a clear and correct knowledge about
Christ.—&#8203;<b>If ye had known me ye should
have known my Father also.</b> <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch8_19">8:19</a>. The practical lesson for us clearly is that
the way to come to a true spiritual knowledge of
the Father is by a study of the life and character
of Christ, and above all by a sympathetic and
personal spiritual acquaintance with him. His
disciples had not known Christ. They had up to
this time believed in him as a temporal Messiah.
Of a Messiah crucified, the power of God
and the wisdom of God unto salvation to Gentile
as well as Jew (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 1:24</span>), they had known
nothing, and hence of God as their Father and
their Friend they knew nothing.—&#8203;<b>From henceforth
ye have known him and have seen
him.</b> From this time. He refers to what he
has already disclosed of the divine nature, in the
washing of the disciples’ feet, in the prophecy
of his own betrayal and death, and in what he is
about to tell them of the spiritual presence of
himself and the Father, through the Holy Spirit,
in their hearts. From the time of this disclosure
it will indeed be their own fault if they fail to
comprehend, at least in some measure, “the
breadth and length and depth and height, and
to know the love of Christ (and so the love of the
Father revealed in and through Christ), which
passeth knowledge” (<span class="muchsmaller">Ephes 3:18, 19</span>).</p>

and character, see <abbr title="Volume One">Vol. I</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 149. Compare the
request of Moses (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> 33:18</span>). Philip has in mind
the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> appearances of God; he wants such a
manifestation of the Deity, <em>a seeing</em> of God.
“One such sight of God would set at rest all
these fears, and give him perfect confidence.”—(<cite>Alford.</cite>)
He wants to walk by sight, and not
by faith. He expresses the universal longing of
humanity for a vision of the unknown. This
request furnishes the text on which the following
discourse is founded. Christ replies that the
unknown Father is manifested to the world in
his Son (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_9">9-11</a></span>), and in the spiritual life, the inward
experience, of those that love him and keep
his commandments (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_15">15-21</a></span>); he points out the
way to secure this inward experience, namely,
by loving the Son and keeping his commandments
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_22">22-26</a></span>); he declares that this indwelling
of the Father in the soul of the believer brings
abundant peace (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_27">27-31</a></span>); it is more than a vision,
it is an abiding, by which the life of God
flows into the soul of man, making it partaker of
the divine nature and fruitful in works of divine
love (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch15_1">15:1-8</a></span>); this love, patterned after and
imbibed from Christ, extends to the world that
hates both the Lord and his disciples (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch15_9">15:9-27</a></span>);
this love, born and kept alive by the indwelling
of the unseen Father, is the illuminator, the instructor,
and the inspirer of him who possesses
it, and gives him assurance of the divine love
and intimacy of spiritual communion with the
divine Being (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch16_1">16</a></span>). See, further,
<a href="#Note_ch14"><abbr title="Preliminary">Prel.</abbr> Note.</a>
There is a real connection in this discourse, though
not that of an oration; the unity is spiritual rather
than intellectual; but it all circles about a single
central truth, the provision which divine love
has made for satisfying the soul-hunger for a
vision of the unseen and invisible God. In a
sense Philip is right, though the <em>sight</em>, if the sight
of a spirit was possible, would not satisfy; but
we see God only as we become like him, and we
shall be satisfied when we awake in his likeness
and so see him as he is (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr>
17:15; 1 John 1:2</span>).—&#8203;<b>Have
I been so much time with you, and
yet hast thou not known me, Philip?</b>
Not merely the length of time is indicated; it
had been but about three years, probably a little
less; but during that three years he had been constantly
with his disciples; they had eaten, slept,
journeyed, lived together; the companionship
was most intimate, the opportunity for familiar
acquaintance perfect.—&#8203;<b>He that hath seen me
hath seen the Father; and how sayest
thou then, Show us the Father?</b> There is
a physical and there is a spiritual sight. The
disciples had known Jesus after the flesh; but
Christ according to the spirit they did not know
till after the descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.
To admire the Son of man is one thing;
to receive the Spirit of God manifested in and
through him is quite different. He that has a
spiritual discernment of Christ will recognize
the spiritual character of the unknown Father,
the truth, mercy, love of God, shining in and
through the Son. There is and can be no physical
vision of God; he is a spirit, and is to be
spiritually known, to be worshipped in spirit as
well as in truth (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch4_24">4:24</a></span>). The language of
Christ here, and indeed throughout this whole
discourse, is utterly inconsistent with the conception
of him as a mere human or superhuman
<em>ambassador</em> of God. He represents not merely

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
the divine government, but the divine Being.
The Father is so in him that whoever looks
within the tabernacle beholds the glory as of the
only begotten of the Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 1:14</span>). He is the
manifestation in the flesh, not of the divine government,
but of God (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 3:16</span>). It is impossible
to refer this answer to the mere union in
sympathy and purpose of Jesus with God. “No
Christian, even if perfected, could say, ‘He that
has seen me has seen Christ.’ How much less,
then, could a Jew, though perfect, have said,
‘He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.’”—(<cite>Godet.</cite>)</p>

driven out the Spirit of God, so that the temple
is destroyed by defilement (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 3:17, marg.</span>); it
ceases to be the temple of God. He dwells no
longer in it. In Christ Jesus there was no sin;
in Christ Jesus, therefore, dwells all the fullness
of the Godhead bodily (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 2:9</span>); and it is by

<cite>From myself</cite> (<span lang="el">ἀπ’ ἐμαυτοῦ</span>). <em>From</em> signifies the

is not in himself, but in the Father, who
dwells in and speaks through him. See <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch5_19"> 5:19</a>,
note.—&#8203;<b>But the Father, he who abides
in me, he doeth the works.</b> Some read,
<cite>doeth his own works</cite>. So Tischendorf and Meyer.
The Received reading is preferable, but the
meaning is much the same. Whether we read,
He that dwelleth in me doeth his own works
(<span lang="el">ποιεῖ τὰ ἔργα ἀυτοῦ</span>), or, He that dwelleth in me,
he it is who doeth the works (<span lang="el">αὐτὸς ποιεῖ τὰ ἔργα</span>),
the emphasis is equally put upon the Father as
the One who, abiding in the Son, does all things
through him. The <em>works</em> are here, not merely
the miracles, but the whole range of beneficent
action of the Son, including certainly the miracles,
but those only as a part of the whole service
of love. This word <em>work</em> (<span lang="el">ἔργον</span>) is rarely, I
think never, used in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> as equivalent to
<em>miracle</em> (<span lang="el">σημεῖον</span>).—&#8203;<b>Have faith in me, that I
am in the Father.</b> Beware of understanding
this as equivalent to, Believe me, on my mere
personal assurance; this is apparently the interpretation
of our English version, and is sustained
by even so eminent an authority as Meyer. It is
grammatically possible; but it neither accords
with Jesus’ use of the word <cite>believe</cite> (<span lang="el">πιστεύω</span>),
which he habitually uses to signify a spiritual apprehension,
not merely an intellectual opinion;
nor with the spirit of this discourse, which, beginning
with <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch14_1">1</a>,
is throughout addressed, not to
the formation of correct opinions, but to the
building up of a right spiritual apprehension of
Christ, and through him of the eternal Father.
The meaning is, <em>Have faith in me that I am in the
Father, and the Father in me</em>; <i>i. e.</i>, Look beneath
the surface, the flesh; behold in the inward
grace, manifesting itself in the outward speech
and action, the lineaments of the divine character;
so have faith in me as one in whom the
Father dwells, and through whom the Father is
made manifest. But if this spiritual sense is
lacking, then—<b>Through</b> (<dfn>by reason of</dfn>, <span lang="el">διά</span>) <b>the
works themselves believe</b>. <span lang="el">Μοι</span> is omitted
by Godet, Meyer, Lachmann, and Tischendorf,
on the authority of the Sinaitic, Cambridge, and
Vatican manuscripts. Christ places his own
character in the front rank, as the principal evidence
of the divine origin and authority of
Christianity. He is his own best witness. But,
for those who cannot discern the divinity of his
life and character, he appeals to the works
wrought by him and by the religion of which he
is the founder, and which was more powerful after
his death than during his life. The evidence
from the miracles, and from the whole miraculous
history of Christianity, is secondary to the
evidence from the character and person of
Christ himself.</p>

because I go to my Father.</b> If by <cite>works</cite>
was meant merely miracles, this declaration
would be difficult of interpretation; for none of
Christ’s disciples have ever wrought greater
miracles than the Master, nor is it easy to conceive
of a greater miracle than the resurrection
of the dead. But if by <cite>works</cite> was meant Christ’s
whole life of beneficent activity, then this promise
has been abundantly fulfilled. For Christ
worked in a very narrow sphere, both of time
and place; for three years, in a province no
larger than the State of Vermont. More souls
were converted at Peter’s preaching on the day

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
of Pentecost than during the whole of Christ’s
personal ministry. At Christ’s death the whole
number of Christian converts does not seem to
have exceeded five hundred, and Christianity
was utterly unknown outside of Palestine. At
John Wesley’s death Methodism had spread
over Great Britain, the Continent of Europe, the
United States, and the West Indies, and its communion
embraced over eighty thousand members.
Whitefield, Wesley, Spurgeon, Moody preached
during their lives to immensely greater numbers
than Christ ever personally taught; and probably
many Christian physicians have healed more
sick than Christ ever healed. Thus in <em>extent</em> the
disciples have already done greater works than
their Master. And this for the reason here assigned,
namely, because he has gone to the Father;
and because of that going the Comforter
has come to bless the labors of the disciples with
a wider and more powerful divine influence than
could, in the nature of the case, proceed from
God incarnate in a single human life (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch16_7">16:7</a></span>).
But we have no right to say that this promise
does not await even further fulfillment. When
the fullness of time shall have come, and God
dwells in all his children in the fullness foreseen
in <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch17_21">17:21</a>,
there may be in them a power over
nature of which modern science gives possibly a
foreshadowing, and which will be, in its effects,
much greater than that which Christ exercised
over it, because they that exercise it will have
the whole earth as their inheritance. Only thus
can I understand such promises as that here and
in Mark 11:23, etc.</p>

John 15:16; 16:23; James 1:5; 1 John 3:22;
5:14, 15. A comparison of these passages shows
clearly that God does not give an unconditional
promise of affirmative answer to every prayer.
This would be to place omnipotence at the command
of ignorance and selfishness; it would be
a curse, not a blessing. The condition here is
embodied in the words, <em>In my name</em>; the promise
is only to those petitions asked in the name
of <em>Jesus Christ</em>. To ask in the name of Christ is
not to introduce his name into the petition, as in
the familiar phrase, For Christ’s sake; nor is it
merely to approach the Father through the mediatorship
of Jesus; this, but much more than
this, is included. “In the name” of any one, as
used in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>, generally, if not always, signifies
representing him, standing in his stead, fulfilling
his purposes, manifesting his will, and
imbued with and showing forth his life and
glory. With John it always has this signification.
Thus, “The works that I do in my Father’s
name” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch10_25">10:25</a></span>) is equivalent to, The
works that I do in my Father’s stead, for him
and by his power and authority; “Blessed is the
King of Israel that cometh in the name of the
Lord” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch12_13">12:13</a></span>) is equivalent to, That cometh
as the representative and manifestation of the
Lord; “The Holy Ghost whom the Father will
send in my name” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_26">14:26</a></span>) is equivalent to,
The Holy Ghost who comes to represent me,
and teach the truths concerning me, and implant
and keep alive my life in the souls of my disciples;
“I kept them in thy name” is equivalent
to, I, as one with thee (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch10_29">10:29</a>, <a href="#ch10_30">30</a></span>), have kept
them within the circle of thine influence, because
within mine own, which is thine. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> Acts
3:6; 4:7; <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:10; <abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 3:17, and notes.
Here, then, the declaration is that whatsoever
we ask, speaking for Christ, seeking his will,
representing him and his interests, and his kingdom,
not merely our own special and personal
interests (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:21</span>), will be granted. So in <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
6:9 (<span class="muchsmaller">see note there</span>) the Lord makes the petition,
“Hallowed be thy name,” the portico to every
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">prayer—so</span> teaching us that in every prayer the
desire for the glory of God should be supreme.
So again in <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:26 the apostle represents us
taught both how and for what to pray by the
Spirit of Christ within us. But every prayer
thus offered in the name of Christ and with a
supreme allegiance to him, representing his kingdom
and imbued by his spirit, will be in character,
like his prayer at Gethsemane. It will carry with
it the petition, “Not my will but thine be done,”
and thus, as Meyer says, “The <em>denial</em> of the
petition is the <em>fulfillment</em> of the prayer, only in
another way.” See 2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 12:8, 9.—&#8203;<b>That the
Father may be glorified in the Son.</b> When
the church is a true representative of Christ,
filled with his spirit, manifesting his character
and life, so that it prays in his name, in his name
casts out devils (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 10:17</span>), and in his name suffers,
filling up what is behind of the Lord’s affliction
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 1:24</span>), and doing all in his stead, as his
representative, and because imbued with his
spirit, then the Father is glorified in the Son,
because he is glorified in humanity, whom he
hath redeemed; for then the glorified and redeemed
church is the body of Christ (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 1:23</span>),

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
the visible manifestation of his invisible presence,
his perpetual incarnation.—&#8203;<b>If ye shall ask
anything in my name, I will do it.</b> The
promise is specific; a promise not merely to provide
generally for the wants of the disciples, but

<p><b>15-17. If ye love me keep my commandments.</b>
The object of the Gospel is the
inspiration of love, not mere obedience; but
obedience is the test because the manifestation
of love. The <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> recognizes no other test of
love to Christ than compliance in the daily life
with his will. See for striking illustration of this,
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch21_15">21:15-17</a>.—&#8203;<b>And I will pray the Father.</b>
The poverty of the English language has prevented
our translators from producing in the
English Bible the distinction between three Greek
verbs, which bear different significations, but are
all indiscriminately translated by the word <cite>pray</cite>.
These are <dfn>to request</dfn> (<span lang="el">προσεύχομαι</span>), <dfn>to ask</dfn> (<span lang="el">ἐρωτάω</span>),
and <dfn>to entreat</dfn> (<span lang="el">αἰτέω</span>). Christ is said in
the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> <em>to request</em> the Father
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 14:23; 26:36;
Mark 1:35, etc.</span>), and <em>to ask</em> of the Father
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch16_26">16:26</a>;
<a href="#ch17_9">17:9</a>; <a href="#ch15_20">15:20</a></span>),
but never <em>to entreat</em> the Father.
Here the second of these words is used. “Our
Lord never uses <em>entreat</em> (<dfn>aitein</dfn>, <dfn>aitesthai</dfn>, <span lang="el">αἰτεῖν</span>
or <span lang="el">αἰτεῖσθαι</span>) of Himself in respect of that
which he seeks on behalf of his disciples from
God; for his is not the <em>petition</em> of the creature to
the Creator, but the request of the Son to the
Father. The consciousness of his equal dignity,
of his potent and prevailing intercession, speaks
out in this, that as often as he asks or declares
that he will ask, anything of the Father, it is
always <em>requesting</em> or <em>inquiring</em> (<dfn>erotas</dfn>, <dfn>erotaso</dfn>,
<span lang="el">ἐρωτάω, ἐρωτήσω</span>), that is, as upon equal terms,
never <em>entreating</em> (<dfn>aiteo</dfn>, <dfn>aiteso</dfn>, <span lang="el">αἰτέω</span> or <span lang="el">αἰτήσω</span>).”—(<cite>Trench.</cite>)
See further <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch16_23">16:23</a>, <a href="#ch16_24">24</a>, note.—&#8203;<b>And
he shall give you another Paraclete.</b>
The original word, inadequately rendered in our
English version by the word <cite>Comforter</cite>, is simply
untranslateable. It is composed of two Greek
words (<span lang="el">παρά καλέω</span>), <dfn>to call to one’s side</dfn>, and signifies
one who is called to aid another. And this
etymological signification of the word indicates
the office of the Holy Spirit in his relations to
us; he is our present help in every time of need,
the one with whom we walk, our Consoler, our
Strength, our Guide, our Peace-giver, our ever
present God. The word <em>Comforter</em> must then be
taken in its etymological and old English sense,
as one who gives not mere consolation, but
strength (<i lang="la">con fortis</i>). He is here called another
Comforter; yet a little below, Christ seemingly
identifies him both with the Father and with
himself, in the declaration “I will manifest myself
to him (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_21">21</a></span>), and we” (<i>i. e.</i>, the Father
and I,) “will make our abode with him” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_23">23</a></span>).
In the Comforter Christ himself is ever present
with his church (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 28:20</span>), for the Comforter
is one with Christ as both are one with the
Father, so that the presence of one is the presence
of all (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:9, 10; <abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 2:20; 4:6</span>). We know too
little of the interior nature of the Deity to be
able to draw any clear distinction between the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. We only
know that as God in the Father is manifested to
us as providing for us, and in the Son as making
atonement for us, so in the Spirit he is manifested
by being spiritually ever present with us.
The mystery of their diversity in unity defies
philosophical analysis. But Christ is speaking to
the experience, not to the intellect; and to the
spiritual experience the father, the Son and the
Holy Ghost, the Provider, the Atoning Saviour
and the Indwelling Spirit, God in nature, in the
flesh, and in our own souls, are one.—&#8203;<b>That he
may abide with you forever.</b> In contrast
with the Son, who came but for a time, and
because he was God <em>manifest in the flesh</em>, could
abide only with a few and only for a limited
period. To long for the laws of the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>, or
even for the visible presence of the limited and
earthly manifestation of God afforded by the
<abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>, is to desire to go back from the broader,
deeper, fuller manifestation, to one narrower
and more limited. To be governed by precedents
or rules of the past is to ignore the perpetually
abiding presence of the Comforter, the
promised guide into all truth. Of his office
Christ speaks more fully in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_26">26</a> and <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch16_7">16:7-15</a>.—&#8203;<b>The
Spirit of Truth.</b> So called, (1)
because it is by giving a spiritual knowledge of
the truth that he ministers to those that receive
him. The Comforter strengthens, guides, liberates,
Sanctifies by the truth (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch8_32">8:32</a>; <a href="#ch16_13">16:13</a>;
<a href="#ch17_17">17:17</a>, <a href="#ch17_19">19</a>;
1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 2:4;

(2) Because his ministry

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
is perfectly true without any admixture of
error. All teaching that is ministered through
human language, even that of Christ and the
apostles, is subject to the errors and the misapprehensions
of the human medium through
which it passes. The instruction of the Spirit,
ministered directly to our spirits, though still
liable to be misapprehended and perverted by us,
is not subject to error in the interpretation. It
is perfect truth; all other teaching is truth with
alloy, from which we must separate it, as best
we may.—&#8203;<b>Whom the world cannot receive.</b>
To be literally understood. <em>Cannot</em> is not here
equivalent to <em>will not</em>. He that is of the world,
living unto it, making it his end, cannot receive
spiritual truth or spiritual influences. His mind is
blinded by the god of this world (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 6:9, 10;
2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr>
4:4</span>). The declaration here is analogous to that
of Christ in John 3:3, “Except a man be born
again he cannot <em>see</em> the kingdom of God,” and to
that of Paul in 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 2:14, “The natural man
receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for
they are foolishness unto him; neither can he
know them; because they are spiritually discerned.”—<b>Because
it seeth him not,
neither knoweth him.</b> There is no visible
manifestation of the Comforter; he is not and
cannot be discerned by the senses as Christ
could be and during his life was, by the manifestation
of his miraculous power; and the unspiritual
has no inward consciousness of his presence,
no spiritual experience of his comfort, strength,
or guidance. Hence, since the Comforter is not
discernible by the outward sense, and the unspiritual
have never had developed within them
the inward sense of faith, they cannot receive
him. In contrast with the world in this respect
is the disciple of Christ, in whom the spiritual
life has been awakened in the new birth.—&#8203;<b>But
ye know him because he abides with
you, and shall be in you.</b> There is no hint
here that the disciples can <em>see</em> the Comforter any
more than the world. This should have prevented
Godet’s misapprehension of this passage,
that “before receiving they must have <em>seen</em> and
known the Spirit.” To see (<span lang="el">θεωρέω</span>) is to recognize
with the senses, or to recognize intellectually
by deductions from what is perceived by the
senses. Neither by sight, nor by deduction from
sight can the Comforter be known. He is known
only by those with and in whom, as a conscious
Presence, he abides. Some texts read <cite>is in you</cite>
instead of <em>shall be in you</em>. The future is the
preferable reading, and the antithesis between
the first and last clauses of the verse indicates
a progressive development in the spiritual life.
The Comforter was even then <em>with</em> the disciples,
though they were not yet ready to receive him;
he was <em>in</em> them, inspiring and moulding their
life and character, after the day of Pentecost.
So he is ever with the church and the individual
Christian; but he is <em>in</em> the church and <em>in</em> the
Christian only when they wait and watch for his
appearing, as the apostles waited and watched
before the day of Pentecost.</p>

<p><b>18-20. I will not leave you orphans.</b>
This, which is the marginal reading, exactly renders
the original. Our English version, <cite>I will not
leave you comfortless</cite>, though made sacred by
many an association, deprives the promise of the
singular significance involved in the original.
An orphan is not a person without parents, but
one who is separated from his parents by death;
memory looks back to them, hope looks forward
to them, but they are not personally present.
Christ declares that he will not thus leave his
disciples. Their Saviour shall be more than a
memory, more than a hope; he will be their personal
present God.—&#8203;<b>I will come to you.</b> He
refers here not to his reappearance in the resurrection,
for that was followed by his disappearance
in the ascension, so that if on this the disciples
alone depended they were left more than
ever before in orphanage. Nor did he then make
his abode with the disciples; he vouchsafed
them only brief and transient appearances of
himself. He does not refer to his second coming;
for the world, as well as his own disciples,
will then see him (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 1:7; 6:15-17</span>). He refers to
that spiritual manifestation which he makes of
himself, and of the Father through him, by the
gift and indwelling of the Holy Spirit, whom the
Father sends in his name. This is clear from
<abbr title="verses">vers.</abbr> <a href="#ch14_19">19</a>,
<a href="#ch14_20">20</a>, <a href="#ch14_23">23</a>,
<a href="#ch14_26">26</a>, etc.—&#8203;<b>Yet a little while
and the world seeth me no more; but ye
see me, because I am living and ye shall
live also.</b> According to the punctuation of
our English version there is here a double promise,
first that the disciples shall again see their
Lord, secondly that they shall share his life.
According to the punctuation which I have
adopted, the second promise is implied rather
than asserted, and is made the basis of the first.
Either is grammatically possible; the second
rendering is preferable, because the whole of
Christ’s teaching here refers not to the life of

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
the disciple, but to the manifestation to him of
his Lord, and because thus the two clauses of
the sentence are brought into close connection.
The soul’s perception of the personal presence
of Christ is then dependent upon sharing his
spiritual life; and this is abundantly taught, both
here and elsewhere. We are changed into the
image of Christ by beholding him (<span class="muchsmaller">2
<abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 3:18</span>), and
we behold him by conforming to his image (<span class="muchsmaller">2
<abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr>
1:5-9</span>). The promise is one of spiritual sight, dependent
upon spiritual life. Since the world
does not and cannot see him (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_17">17</a></span>), arguments
based on visible phenomena to prove the reality
of that which is a spiritual experience are always
in vain. Hence the futility of the ordinary
methods of arguing with skeptics. They are
endeavors to prove to the blind; whereas the
blind must first <em>see</em>, then learn.—&#8203;<b>At that day
ye shall know that I am in the Father,
and ye in me and I in you.</b> <em>That day</em> was
in the history of the church the day of Pentecost,
when the Spirit was first revealed with
power to the entire body of believers. But each
believing soul has also its Pentecost, when it
first learns the meaning of Christ’s promises in
this chapter. This is to it <em>that day</em>, the one great
day of its existence. It is not said that the disciple
will understand <em>how</em> the Father, the Son,
and the disciples are in one another, but he will
know it <em>as a fact</em>; the unity of the Father and
the Son, and the indwelling of both in the believer,
will become a part of his experience. This
experience, promised here, is expressed as a
realized fact by Paul in <abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 2:20: “I am crucified
with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not
I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I
now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the
Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for
me.”</p>

<p><b>21.</b> Having given expression to the mystical
truth of the spiritual manifestation of their Lord
to the believers, Christ next states the conditions
under which it is realized. These are
not <em>external</em>; this spiritual revelation is not made
dependent upon retiring from the world and
living a life of asceticism and artificial self-denial.
They are not <em>intellectual</em>; this revelation
and indwelling of Christ is not made dependent
upon the creed of the disciple. They are <em>moral</em>;
practical obedience to the words of Christ assures
spiritual enjoyment of his presence and
companionship.—&#8203;<b>He that hath my commandments
and keepeth them.</b> These
clauses are not to be read as repetitions of the
same idea, made for the sake of emphasis. To
<em>have</em> is not the same as to <em>keep</em>. He hath Christ’s
commandments <em>not</em> who has a knowledge of
them, so that the promise is conditional upon a
certain degree of Christian education, but who
has a <em>spiritual apprehension of them</em>, who appreciates
their spirit. Since all of Christ’s commands
are comprised in the one direction “Follow
me,” the first condition of receiving this
spiritual manifestation of Christ as a real and
living Presence in the daily life, is a spiritual
appreciation of his life and character as they are
disclosed in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>, and therewith a like appreciation
of the precepts, principles, and spirit
of the life which he has inculcated. He <em>keeps</em>
Christ’s commandments who carefully guards
them in his daily life, regarding them as a possession
which he is in danger of losing. See
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 19:17, note.—&#8203;<b>That one is he that loveth
me.</b> The evidence of love which Christ
recognizes is not profession, or ceremonial, or
emotional experience, or intellectual opinion, but
spiritual appreciation of his precepts and practical
obedience to them. The good Samaritan is
a more acceptable lover than the priest or the
Levite.—&#8203;<b>He that loveth me shall be loved
of my Father, and I will love him.</b> Every
disciple may thus become a “beloved disciple.”
For the love here spoken of is not that love of
compassion which the Father and the Son have
for the whole world (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch3_16">3:16</a></span>), even while it was
dead in trespasses and sins (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr>
 2:4, 5</span>), but the
love of spiritual fellowship and personal friendship
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch15_14">15:14</a>, <a href="#ch15_15">15</a>;
<abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 4:7</span>). “There is between
these two feelings the same difference as between
a man’s compassion for his guilty and unhappy
neighbors and the affection of a father for his
child or of a husband for his wife.”—(<cite>Godet.</cite>)
Christ is here speaking not of the condition on
which men may become his disciples; he is instructing
his disciples, is pointing out the condition
on which each one of them may come into a
higher spiritual experience of their Master’s love
and spiritual presence. This is indicated not
only by the context and general character of the
discourse, but also by the peculiar language
here, <cite>That one it is who loveth me</cite>. <em>That one</em>
(<span lang="el">ἐκεῖνος</span>) indicates an exceptional individual, one
among many, who, by his course, becomes the
special friend of Jesus.</p>

(the brother) of James.” See Note on Twelve
Apostles, <abbr title="Volume One">Vol. I</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 149.—&#8203;<b>Lord, and what
has happened that thou wilt manifest
thyself to us, but not at all</b> (<span lang="el">οὐχὶ</span>) <b>to the
world?</b> His question is not, as represented by
our English version, the expression of a mere
curiosity, In what way wilt thou make this manifestation
of thyself? it is the expression of
amazement and perplexity. All the disciples
were anticipating that Christ would manifest his
Messiahship in some unexpected manner, striking
terror into the hearts of all his opponents,
and becoming, by some miraculous forth-putting
of power, King of kings and Lord of lords. Judas,
hastily concluding that there is to be no
other manifestation than that of which Christ is
now speaking, expresses his amazement and perplexity.
What has happened to lead to the
abandonment of a world manifestation of the
Messiah? is the meaning of his question. But
Christ has not said that he will not at all be
manifested to the world; only that the world
cannot see that manifestation of him of which
he is now speaking.—&#8203;<b>Jesus answered and
said unto him.</b> He does not reply to the
question of Judas; enters into no explanation;
simply reiterates that the condition of receiving
the spiritual manifestation of Christ as a personal
Presence is obedience to his directions.
Christ never suffers himself to be turned aside
from practical instruction by inquiries in theoretical
theology.—&#8203;<b>If any one loves me, he
will keep my word.</b> <em>Word</em>, not <em>words</em>; singular,
not plural. His command is but one
word: love.—&#8203;<b>My Father will love him, and
we will come unto him and make our
abode with him.</b> This promise is more than
the preceding one (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_21">21</a></span>). There Christ promises
simply that the obedient disciple shall see
his Lord; here that he shall become a temple in
which his Lord will constantly dwell; there
that Christ shall manifest himself to the soul;
here that the Father and the Son shall dwell in
the soul. “They shall come like wanderers
from their home and lodge with him; will be
daily his guests, yea, house and table companions.”—(<cite>Meyer.</cite>)
Thus Christ by his commandments
knocks at the door of the heart; he that
hath those commandments hears the voice; he
that keeps them opens the door (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 3:20</span>). Thus,
too, the Christian’s experience on earth is a
foretaste of his experience in heaven. “Here
below it is God who dwells with the believer;
above, it will be the believer who will dwell with
God.”—(<cite>Godet.</cite>) By his language here, <cite>We will
come unto him</cite>, Christ identifies himself as the
companion of the Father in the spiritual experience
of the disciple. See <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>

<p><b>24.</b> In contrast with the disciple who <em>has</em> and
<em>keeps</em> the word of Christ, our Lord portrays the
opposite character. He loves not Christ; he
makes no attempt to treasure and guard his instruction;
and in rejecting the word and its
Bearer he rejects the Father whom the Bearer
represents and by whom the word is given.
Beware of reading the negative, “The word is
not mine,” as equivalent to The word is not
merely mine. Christ here, as in many other
passages, disavows the paternity of his own instructions.
They are not his; they are the Father’s
who dwells in him, and inspires the words
and performs the works. See <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>

<p><b>25, 26. These things have I spoken unto

As far as this I am able to carry my instructions,
but no farther; the Spirit shall complete
them. Christ has already contrasted the work
of the Spirit with his own: his own dwelling
with his disciples is temporary, the abiding of
the Spirit is forever; he speaks <em>to</em> his disciples,
the Spirit speaks <em>in</em> them (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_16">16</a>, <a href="#ch14_17">17</a></span>). He now
indicates a further point in the contrast. His
own teaching was partial; for he had many
things to say which they could not bear (<span class="muchsmaller">John
<a href="#ch16_12">16:12</a></span>), and much which he did say they could
not understand till their experience, developed
by the indwelling of the Spirit of God, had prepared
them to comprehend it. But the promised
Spirit shall, as the Christian is able to bear the
truth, teach all things.—&#8203;<b>But the Comforter.</b>
See above on <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch14_16">16</a>.—&#8203;<b>The Holy Spirit.</b> That
is, the Spirit of holiness. As he is the Spirit of
truth, because all experience of the higher spiritual
truth comes in and through him, so he is
the Spirit of holiness, because all holiness of life
and character is wrought out by the soul only as
the Holy Spirit works in and with us the good
pleasure of God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:12, 13; <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 13:20, 21</span>).—&#8203;<b>Whom
the Father will send in my name.</b>
As the disciple is to pray in Christ’s name (<span class="muchsmaller">see
<abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch14_13">13</a>, note</span>), so the Father will answer him in
Christ’s name. That name is Jesus, <i>i. e.</i>, Saviour,
because he saves his people from their
sins (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 1:21</span>), and Christ, <i>i. e.</i>, The Anointed

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
One, because he is the High Priest who makes
atonement for the sins of his people, and reconciles
them unto God. See <abbr title="Volume One">Vol. I</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 57, Note,
etc., on Names of Jesus. The Holy Spirit is,
then, sent in his name, not because he is sent in
his stead; he is not; the work of the Spirit and
of the Son are not the one in lieu of the other;
nor because he is sent in answer to the intercessory
prayer of the Son; the love of the Father is the
cause of the dispensation of the Spirit, as of the
incarnation and the atonement of the Son; but
because he is sent to complete the work of the
Son, to perfect that salvation which is represented
by the name Jesus, and that atonement and reconciliation
which is represented by the word
Christ (<span class="muchsmaller">John 3:5, 6; 7:39; <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:14-16, 26; 14:17; <abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr>
5:16, 17; <abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 2:18, etc.</span>).—&#8203;<b>He shall teach you
all things.</b> That is, all things respecting the
divine life.—&#8203;<b>And bring to your remembrance
all things whatsoever I have said
unto you.</b> “He will teach new truths by
recalling the old, and will recall the old by teaching
the new.”—(<cite>Godet.</cite>) In its application to
the apostles, this is a promise of inspiration and
a guarantee of substantial accuracy, both in
their reports of events and of the instructions of
Jesus Christ, and in their interpretation of the
laws and principles of the spiritual life. “It is
in the fulfillment of this promise to the apostles
that their sufficiency as witnesses of all that the
Lord did and taught, and consequently the authenticity
of the Gospel narrative, is grounded.”—(<cite>Alford.</cite>)
But there is no reason to limit this
promise to the twelve to whom it was immediately
spoken. It occurs in the middle of a
discourse which by universal consent belongs to
the church universal. There is no consistency
in claiming the promise of the manifestation of
Christ in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_21">21</a>, the indwelling of the Father
and the Son in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_23">23</a>, and the peace of God in
<abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch14_27">27</a>,
and rejecting the promise of inspired
instruction in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_26">26</a>. This promise, then, like
that of <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 28:20, is made to the church for
all time; it is a promise of a continually progressive
instruction in the spiritual life, adapted
to varying needs and exigencies, both of the
community and of the individual, carrying on to
its consummation the necessarily incomplete instruction
of the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>, as well as making clear to
the spiritual apprehension that which preceding
generations either imperfectly understood,
wholly failed to understand, or only partially
comprehended. The spiritual guide of the
church is not an official hierarchy, nor ecclesiastical
tradition, but the living experience of those
that love Christ, have his words and keep them.
This promise points to and assures the church
of a progressive Christian theology, and corresponds
with the apostle Paul’s declaration, “We
know in part and we prophesy in part” (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr>

<p><b>27. Peace I leave with you; my peace
I give unto you.</b> As the peace of a child depends
on the presence of his mother, so the
peace of these disciples on the presence of their
Lord. He speaks to their unuttered forebodings,
and declares that he will leave this peace
in his departure as a legacy to them. But he
will do more than this. Thus far they have had
peace in his presence; he will henceforth impart
to them his own source of strength in sending to
them the indwelling Spirit of God, so that they
shall have, as he had, peace in themselves. “<cite>My
peace</cite>” implies the peace which belongs to himself,
is a characteristic of his own experience and
a part of his own nature. So in <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 4:7 the
“peace of God” is that peace which is characteristic
of the Divine Being. It was this
peace which enabled Christ to stand unmoved
and unperturbed in the court of Caiaphas and
the hall of Pilate. It was the fulfillment of this
promise which enabled the apostles to meet in
like manner, unfearing and untroubled, the
threats and persecutions of the authorities in
Jerusalem immediately after the day of Pentecost
(<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 4:8, 19, 31; 5:29, 41</span>); which gave Stephen
serenity in the storm of stones (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 6:15; 7:59, 60</span>);
enabled Peter to sleep in chains (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 12:6</span>); gave
to Paul and Silas their songs in the night (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts
16:25</span>); kept Paul unmoved in the midst of the
mob at Jerusalem (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 21:31-40</span>), and in the peril
of shipwreck (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 27:21-26, 31-35</span>). Compare also,
for expressions of this peace of Christ in the
Christian’s experience, <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 5:1-5; 8:35-39;
2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 4:7-9; <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 4:11-13; <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr>, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 4. This
peace is a characteristic of the divine nature
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 4:7</span>), therefore a characteristic of Christ,
who is called Prince of Peace, because one of the
distinguishing characteristics of his kingdom is
peace (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 9:6; <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 14:17</span>); therefore a fruit of
the Spirit in the experience of the followers of
Christ (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:6; <abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 5:22</span>); therefore the privilege
and duty of every disciple, who because of
his peace and his power to bestow it upon others
is called a son of God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:9</span>). It is therefore
not the peculiar luxury of a favored few, but

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
the duty and privilege of all (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 2:10</span>); not dependent
on temperament or circumstances, but
on a faith which receives and recognizes an indwelling
God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 5:1; <abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 2:14; <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 4:9</span>); not
the occasional siesta of the wearied worker, but
the abiding spirit and sacred power of his work
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr>
4:7; <abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 1:11; 3:15</span>). It is not without Spiritual
significance that Christ’s last words, as of
“one who is about to go away and says goodnight
and leaves his blessing” (<cite>Luther</cite>), are a
promise of peace.—&#8203;<b>Not as the world giveth
give I unto you.</b> The wish of peace was a
customary leave-taking among the Jews
(<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Samuel">Sam.</abbr>
1:17; Luke 7:50; Acts 16:36; 1 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr>
5:14; 3 John 14. Compare
<abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 43:23; Judges 6:23</span>).
Christ distinguishes his
promise here from the salutations, which were
often, as with us, mere empty formalities, and
which at best were but wishes or possibly prayers.
This salutation is more than a benediction,
it is the promise of an actual gift.—&#8203;<b>Let not
your heart be troubled, neither let it be
afraid.</b> He thus returns to the opening words
of his discourse, words of strength-giving and
reassurance (<span class="muchsmaller">see

would rejoice.</b> There is a gentle rebuke in
this language. It does not involve a denial or
even a doubt of their love, but it recalls them
from the selfish thoughts fixed wholly on their
own sorrow to their allegiance and love to him.
It may well be repeated to ourselves in the hour
of <span style="white-space:nowrap;">death—parting</span> from any Christian friend.
Their thought of their own future gives them
comfort (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_2">2</a> and <a href="#ch14_3">3</a></span>); their thought of Christ’s

peace (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_26">26</a>, <a href="#ch14_27">27</a></span>);
their thought of his glory and
their love for him gives them joy. Thus in the
fruit of the Spirit joy and peace follow because
they grow out of love (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 5:22</span>). We, as well as
they, should rejoice, not sorrow, because Christ
no longer dwells incarnate on the earth, but has
gone to the Father.—&#8203;<b>Because I said I go
unto the Father: for my Father is greater
than I.</b> His departure to be with the greater
Father was to be a cause of rejoicing, not merely
to the eleven, but to his church universal. This
is not because he is thus enabled to ensure his
disciples a more powerful and perfect protector,
for the protection of the Father is accorded
through the Son, and as a protector the Son is
one in power as well as in will with the Father
(<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch10_30">10:30</a>, note</span>). Moreover, it is our love for
Christ, not the thought of our own interest, not
even our spiritual interest, which is the secret of
the joy which the Christian should experience in
the exaltation of his Lord. Nor is the cause of that
joy the fact that Christ was about to enter into
glory and blessedness; for it is of the <em>greatness</em>,
not of the <em>blessedness</em> of the Father, nor of his own
heavenly condition, Christ speaks; the phrase,
“The Father is greater than I,” cannot, without
violation of the meaning, be rendered, The Father
is more blessed than I. It is true that
because the Father is <em>greater</em> than Christ, Christ
in going to the Father went to a condition of
greater power for his own redemptive work, for
the up-building of that kingdom to which he and
his followers are consecrated. Christ is more to
his followers, more powerful in his work of redeeming
love, in the Spirit than in the flesh,
absent from his disciples and with the Father
than absent from the Father and with the disciples.
But more than this, more than in our
ignorance of both the Father and Son we can
comprehend, is meant by the declaration that
Christ’s going to the Father was an exaltation,
and in that exaltation we, his followers,
ought to rejoice with and in him, if indeed we
love him. The declaration, “<cite>The Father is
greater than I</cite>,” is not inconsistent with the preceding
declaration, “He that hath seen me hath
seen the Father,” for that declaration is interpreted
by the one which immediately follows,
“I am in the Father and the Father in me;”
he that has a spiritual apprehension of Christ
has a spiritual apprehension of the Father, who
is manifested in and through him. Nor is it
inconsistent with Christ’s declaration, “I and
my Father are one,” for Christ as the protector
of his people may be one with the Father, and
yet the Father may be greater than the Son in
the eternal relation between the two. Nor is it
inconsistent with John’s declaration that “The
Word was God,” for the <em>Word</em> is not Jesus
Christ (<span class="muchsmaller">see <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_1">1:1</a>, note</span>), but God as manifested to
the race, Jesus Christ being the Word <em>made flesh</em>
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_14">1:14</a></span>). It is inconsistent with any view of
Christ’s character which denies the essential
divinity of his nature; for the creature cannot
say of God, without an extraordinarily irreverent
egotism, “My Father is greater than I.”
“The creature who should say, ‘God is greater
than I,’ would blaspheme no less than one who
should say, ‘I am equal with God.’ God alone
can compare himself with God.”—(<cite>Godet.</cite>) It
accords with Christ’s habitual teaching concerning
himself, as one who is sent forth the
Father, derives his authority from the Father,
does all things through the power of the Father,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
in all things obeys the will of the Father, and
will return to the Father again (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 11:26, 27;

the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> generally,
which constantly represents Christ as receiving
his divine power as Creator, Redeemer, and
Judge from the Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr>
1:20-22; <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:9;
<abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 1:8, 9;
1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 15:28</span>).
Jesus Christ is God <em>manifest
in the flesh</em>, and God in his absolute essence
is greater than any manifestation of him is or
can be. As the artist is greater than his picture,
the architect than his house, the orator
than his oration, so God is greater than the
Word through which he utters himself to human
apprehension. In thus interpreting this much
debated passage, according to the plain and natural
meaning of the words, and, as it seems to
me, the teachings of Christ and his apostles, I
accept substantially the interpretation of Meyer,
who sees in this declaration an illustration of
“the absolute monotheism of Jesus
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch17_3">17:3</a></span>),
and of the whole <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>, according to which the
Son, although of divine essence, of one nature
with the Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_1">1:1</a>; <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:6;
<abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 1:15-18</span>), nevertheless
was and is and remains subordinated
to the Father, the immutably higher one, since
the Son as Organ, as Commissioner of the Father,
as Intercessor with Him, etc., has received
his whole power in the kingly office from the
Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_5">17:5</a></span>), and, after the accomplishment
of the work committed to him, will restore it to
the Father (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 15:28</span>).”
To the same effect,
but more concisely, Edward H. Sears (<cite>Heart of
Christ</cite>): “God as absolute is more than God as
revealed.” Similarly Olshausen and Ellicott’s
Commentary. Observe, however, that Christ’s
language here involves only the relations between
the Son as incarnate and the Father; in saying that
the Son <em>was</em> and <em>remains</em> subordinated to the Father,
Meyer attributes to the words here a meaning
confessedly borrowed from other passages.</p>

<p>Two other interpretations have been offered
from the orthodox point of view: (1) That Christ
speaks here of himself <em>as a man</em>. But this ancient
interpretation, invented in the early controversy
with the Arians, and revived recently by Ryle, has
not, I think, despite the authority of Augustine
in its favor, the sanction of a single modern exegetical
scholar of any eminence. It is repudiated
by Schaff, Godet, Luthardt, Meyer, Alford, Tholuck.
This easy method of solving the seeming
contradictions of Christ’s mysterious nature is
utterly untenable, for whatever opinion may be
entertained respecting his twofold nature as
both God and man, no reader is authorized to
say what acts and words were manifestations of
the human and what of the divine nature. It is
utterly inapplicable here, for “this interpretation
implies a mere platitude. Who needs to be
told that the human nature is inferior to the divine?”—(<cite>Schaff.</cite>)
(2) That Christ here compares
his present earthly condition with that to which
he will attain in going to the Father. This is
Calvin’s interpretation. “Christ does not here
make a comparison between the divinity of the
Father and his own, nor between his own human
nature and the divine essence of the Father, but
rather between his present state and the heavenly
glory to which he is afterwards to be received.”
To the same effect, substantially, are
Alford, Luthardt, and Tholuck. This is certainly
involved in the language; the return from
union with humanity to union with the Father
was a change from a lower and lesser to a higher
and greater condition. But much more is involved,
for Christ by his words institutes a comparison,
not between his earthly and his heavenly
condition, as does Paul in <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:6-11, but between
himself and his Father.</p>

<p><b>29-31. And now I have told you *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
that when it is come to pass ye might
have faith.</b> That is, before the Passion he
foretells it and directs the thoughts and hopes
of his disciples to a point beyond, to the results
which are to be produced by the crucifixion, so
that when the night of darkness comes these
words may remain to keep alive their faith in
him as one not <em>dead</em>, but only gone to the companionship
of the Father, and coming again <em>with
the Father</em> to be the spiritual and indwelling
companion of his own. Indirectly the office of
prophecy is implied in these words; it is not to
give in the present a clear view of the future,
but to sustain faith and hope and courage, and
make it clear to the believer, when the events
themselves take place, that nothing is unexpected
and unprovided for by his Father and
Saviour.—&#8203;<b>The prince of this world is coming.</b>

punctuated. There should be no break in the
verse. Christ knew that Judas had gone out to
perfect arrangements for the betrayal, knew the
shame and torture that were before him, knew
also the power of the Father to accomplish the
world’s redemption by that suffering if it was
endured to the end, and bade his disciples arise
that they might go forth with him, as he went
forth to show the world his love for and obedience
to the Father. Thus, as he has just told

him by their obedience (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>

<p><a id="Note_ch15"></a><span class="smcap">Preliminary Note.</span>—Some scholars suppose
that Christ, at the close of the preceding discourse,
arose with his disciples and passed out
of the room where they had been at supper into
the valley of the Kedron, the vicinity of the garden
of Gethsemane, and that the discourse was
continued there, in or near one of the vineyards
which abound in the neighborhood of the city.
Others suppose that they arose to go; that, the
heart of the Master being surcharged with the
truth which he was endeavoring to express to
them, the Divine Immanence, he broke forth
afresh with the same truth in a new form, and
that the discourse recorded in this and the next
chapter, and the prayer recorded in <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#CHAPTER_XVII">17</a>, were
uttered in the same room in which the preceding
discourse was uttered. Both suppositions
are purely conjectural; the latter appears to me
the more rational, because: (1) The truths embodied
in this and the succeeding chapter are the
same as the one embodied in the preceding one;
the form alone varies. The structure and the fibre
of the discourse is that of one which flows from a
heart burdened with a profound truth which can
be expressed only by reiteration, and even then
only inadequately. (2) It is hardly credible that
such a conversation could have been uttered, as
some have imagined, while Jesus and his disciples
were on their way out of the city; and no
reason is offered for the hypothesis that it was
abruptly broken off and transferred to another
and apparently less convenient place. (3) <abbr title="Chapter">Ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch18_1">18:1</a> plainly implies that Jesus did not <em>go forth</em>,
<i>i. e.</i>, from the room where they were gathered,
till the end of this conversation with them and
after the prayer with which it was closed. Various
hypotheses have also been proffered respecting
the probable circumstance that suggested
to Christ the metaphor which underlies
the first part of this chapter: Vineyards on the
way to Gethsemane (<cite>Lampe</cite>), the carved vine on
the great doors of the temple (<cite>Rosenmuller</cite>), a
vine trained about the window of the great
chamber (<cite>Knapp</cite>), the cup so lately partaken
(<cite>Meyer</cite>, <cite>Stier</cite>), <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> symbolism of the vineyard
and the vine (<cite>Alford</cite>). These are also all conjectural;
it is enough to say that the parable
here must be studied in the light of the teachings
both of nature and of the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> use of nature
in the passages below referred to. The use of
the vine as a symbol by <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> prophets was so
familiar that it could hardly have been absent
from the minds of both Christ and the apostles.
Examine with care <abbr title="Jeremiah">Jer.</abbr> 2:21; <abbr title="Ezekiel">Ezek.</abbr> 15:2, 6; and
especially Psalm 80:8-19, and Isaiah 5:1-7. The
truth taught here by a metaphor is the same as
that taught in the preceding chapter unmetaphorically,
and in other passages by other metaphors.
(1) The vine and its branches are a perpetual
parable of Christ and his church. It is
not enough to learn of Christ as from a teacher,
to follow him as an example, or to accept forgiveness
through him as both priest and sacrifice;
we must be personally united to him, and
from him draw our spiritual life, and so grow
into his image. As the branch draws its sap by
a continuous flow from the vine, and becomes
identified with it in character, and bears its
fruit, and dies when separated from it, so we
must abide in a living Christ, draw our spiritual
sustenance from him, become more and more
Christlike in our nature, and bear his fruit in
our lives. See John <a href="#ch6_56">6:56-58</a>, note, and refs.
there cited. (2) In the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> imagery the vine
planted by the husbandman was the house of
Israel. But despite the divine cultivator it
brought forth wild grapes; it proved to be no
<em>true</em> vine. Wherefore it was broken down, laid
waste, burned, and a new vine was planted in its
place. This <em>true</em> vine is Christ; not the man
Christ Jesus, but the living, abiding Christ, the
Christ who is with his people alway, even unto
the end of the world (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 28:20</span>), the Christ

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
whose true body is his church (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 12:27</span>), who
is the head from which they all draw their life
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 4:15; <abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 1:18</span>), who reproduces himself in
every true disciple, since only they in whom is
the spirit of Christ are truly his (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:9</span>), and
who is thus far more widely and potently in the
earth to-day than he ever was or could be in the
flesh. This living and perpetually incarnate
Christ is in a sense identical with his living
church, as the vine is identical with its branches;
for as there could be no vine without branches,
so neither could this Christ be without the
church which he animates. This Christ incarnate,
not in the body of a single man, but in the
church universal which is now his body, is the
true Israel of God, the nation to whom the kingdom
of God has been given, that was taken from
the old Israel because it brought not forth the
fruits thereof (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 21:43</span>). This <em>true</em> vine is contrasted
with the old Israel which proved to be no
true vine. No longer is there any possibility
that the vine shall be broken down and destroyed
with fire as the old vine was (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 5:5; <abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr>
80:16</span>); but each branch that abides not in this
everlasting vine, this living, perpetually incarnate
and ever extending Christ, is broken off
from the vine and destroyed. In brief, in studying
this parable, the student must not forget,
what the commentators have often forgotten,
that throughout this last discourse with his disciples
Christ speaks of himself not as a man
about to die, but as a living Christ, forever incarnate
in the hearts and lives of his own, living
on in the world with mightier and wider influence,
and in more intimate communion and companionship
with his disciples after his crucifixion
than before. It is this ever-living Christ, reproduced
in all his members, and spreading over
the whole earth, that is the true vine, in contrast
with the old Israel, which proved to be no true
vine; of this vine the Father is the husbandman;
in this vine each individual disciple is a
branch or shoot.</p>

(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch6_32">6:32</a>, <a href="#ch6_33">33</a></span>), the spiritual
being the true, the external and material
being the shadows that are “figures of the
true” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 9:24</span>). The images of the Bible, especially
those employed by Christ, are not merely
poetic figures. The outward world is a real
symbol of the invisible world, physical growths
are a parable of spiritual growths, the kingdom
of nature a picture of the kingdom of grace,
because both come from the same creative hand,
are made subject to the same great laws, and
are under the same great King. The physical
vine is the shadow; Christ is the true, real vine,
whom the shadow symbolizes; and it will last
when the shadow has passed away; as he is the
true priest and sacrifice, outlasting the apparent
priest and sacrifice of the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> dispensation.—&#8203;<b>My
Father is the husbandman.</b> Cultivating
the vine, and superintending its growth.
This cultivation has been going on through the
centuries, in all the growth of that invisible but
perpetually incarnated Christ whose body is the
church, and who dwells in and is therefore represented
by all his members. The language
shows clearly that it is not of the man Christ
Jesus about to die upon the cross, but of the
ever-living Christ, immanent in the Holy Catholic
Church, that he here speaks.—&#8203;<b>Every
branch in me that beareth not fruit.</b>
How can a branch be in Christ and bear no
fruit? Calvin’s explanation that <em>in me</em> is equivalent
to <em>supposed to be in me</em> is inadmissible. It
does not explain Christ’s words, but substitutes
others for them. Alford’s explanation is better,
but it labors under the serious disadvantage of
substituting for Christ’s declaration “I am the
vine,” the very different declaration, The visible
church is the vine. “The vine is the visible
church here, of which Christ is the <em>inclusive</em>
head; the vine <em>contains</em> the branches, hence the
unfruitful as well as the fruitful are <em>in me</em>.”
But to be in the visible church and to be in living
communion with Christ are very different
things. I should rather say that Christ here
lays down, in a simile, the general law that to
him that hath shall be given, and from him that
hath not shall be taken away even that which he
hath. If the soul, in the measure in which it
has knowledge of Christ, bears Christian fruit,
it will grow more and more into oneness with
and likeness of Christ; if, on the other hand, it
does not realize the fruits of its knowledge in a
life fruitful in Christian works, it will gradually
lose its knowledge and become separated from
Christ. Thus both the grafting into and the
separating from the vine are in the spiritual experience
gradual processes, and they depend on
the fidelity with which the conscious branch
avails itself of its privilege, and shows itself
worthy of larger privilege. Thus Christ gives
grace for grace (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_16">1:16</a></span>).—&#8203;<b>He taketh away.</b>
The same word (<span lang="el">αἴρω</span>) is used in 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 5:2 of

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
excommunication; that indicates the meaning
here. It is not declared that the fruitless
Christian shall be destroyed, though later, in
<abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch15_6">6</a>,
destruction is declared to be the final
result of cutting off from Christ. Fruitlessness
cuts off (excommunicates) the soul from communion
with and drawing life from Christ; this
ends in spiritual withering, death, and destruction
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch15_6">6</a></span>). Thus this declaration is the converse
of that of <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_23">14:23</a>, “If a man love me
he will keep my words (bear my fruit), and my
Father will love him, and we will come unto
him and make our abode with him.” If he keep
not Christ’s words (bear not Christ’s fruit), he
will not have the abiding of the Father and the
Son. The fruit of Christ is the same as the fruit
of the Spirit (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 5:22, 23</span>); and in the measure in
which this fruit is borne in the life, is the soul
enriched in the spiritual knowledge of Christ
which enables it to bear still more fruit. Thus
fruitfulness in the life develops the consciousness
of Christ’s indwelling, and the consciousness
of Christ’s indwelling in the soul develops
Christian fruitfulness in the life. The whole
truth is well illustrated by 2 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 1:5-9.—&#8203;<b>And
every branch that beareth fruit, he
cleanseth it that it may bring forth more
fruit.</b> The word rendered in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch15_2">2</a> <em>purgeth</em> and
that rendered in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch15_3">3</a>
<em>clean</em> are radically the same.
Christ cleanseth the soul (1) by the operation of
the law that right doing develops right feeling
and opens the heart to higher influences
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch7_17">7:17</a></span>);
(2) by the sanctifying influences of the Holy
Spirit, which is given to each soul in the measure
in which each proves itself worthy of and willing
to receive him; (3) by the discipline of life, which
is the manifestation of God’s special love to the
soul (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 12:6</span>). The object of all this redemptive
work is in order that (<span lang="el">ἵνα</span>) the soul may
bring forth more fruit. Thus Christian fruitfulness
in the life is both the condition and the final
result of the divine purifying process in the life
of the soul.</p>

to which it is introductory. <dfn>Through</dfn> (<span lang="el">δὶα</span>) always

The spoken word is the instrument in God’s

(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_17">17:17</a></span>);
and when received by an obedient faith, becomes
the means of regeneration (<span class="muchsmaller">James 1:18; 1 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 1:23</span>)
and the power of God unto salvation
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 1:16</span>).
This word is not any particular utterance of Christ,
but his whole ministry, both of promise and
teaching, including his gift of pardon and peace,
and his call to Christian activity. The meaning,
then, is this: You are already cleansed from
past sin through your acceptance of and obedience
to my word. But you are not to imagine
that my work is done when I depart and cease
to be visibly present with you. You are still to
abide in me spiritually; for without this spiritual
abiding all your past cleansing can accomplish
nothing; without me as a living and life-giving
Saviour you can bear no Christ-like fruit
in your lives. The lesson for us is that Christ’s
work was not finished (though his sacrifice was)
on the cross, that our work is not finished in
accepting forgiveness through him and consecrating
ourselves to obedience to his will, but
that the finished work of his death was only
preparatory for the entire work of his life in us
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 5:10</span>), and that our acceptance of pardon is
only a preparation for a life continually hid with
Christ in God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 2:20;
<abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 3:3</span>).—&#8203;<b>Abide in me
and I in you.</b> This is not a direction and a
promise, equivalent to, If you abide in me I will
abide in you; it is a twofold direction: Abide
in me; see to it that I abide in you. It thus
implies that Christ’s indwelling in us is dependent
upon ourselves. If any man hear Christ’s
voice and opens the door, Christ comes in to
him and sups with him (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 3:20</span>). He that hungers
and thirsts after righteousness is filled (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
5:6</span>). By fidelity and obedience we abide in
Christ; by docility and spiritual obedience we
open the door that Christ may abide with us.—&#8203;<b>As
the branch cannot bear fruit of itself</b>
(<span lang="el">ἀφ ἑαυτοῦ</span>) <b>except it abide in the vine, no
more can ye except ye abide in me</b>. So
the Son can do nothing of <em>himself</em>
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch5_19">5:19</a>, note</span>),
but does all things abiding in and through the
power of the Father. The disciple abiding in
Christ comes at last to abide with Christ in the
Father; and this is the consummation, when the
Father becomes all in all (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_21">17:21</a>, <a href="#ch17_24">24</a>; 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 15:28</span>).
Thus all spiritual life comes from the Father by
Christ, through the instrumentality of the word,
to the soul that abides in and with Christ as
Christ abides in and with the Father.</p>

is not the preparation for and the condition
of spiritual life; spiritual life is the preparation
for and the condition of moral excellence.
Though each promotes the other, the first step
for the reforming soul should be to seek union
with Christ, without whom we can do nothing.
Contrast with Christ’s declaration here Paul’s
in <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 4:13, “I can do all things through
Him (Christ) that strengtheneth me.” No conclusion
can be drawn from this utterance respecting
the vexed question of the natural ability
of the soul to repent of sin and accept Christ by
faith. For Christ is here speaking to those who
have thus accepted him, and he declares simply
the condition of fruitful Christian activity for
all those who are, at least in avowed purpose,
already his.—&#8203;<b>In case any one shall not have
abided in me he has been cast out like
the branch that is withered, and they
gather them together and they are burned.</b>
This translation is Meyer’s, who thus comments
on the significance of the change in the tenses:
“Jesus places himself at the point of time of
the execution of the last judgment, when those
who have fallen away from him are gathered
together and cast into the fire, after they have
been previously cast out of his communion and
become withered, having completely lost the
true life.” They that gather the withered
branches for the fire are not <em>men</em>, but the angels
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 13:49, 50</span>). The metaphorical language ought
not, however, to be too far pressed. The parable
ends in a tragic consummation, but Christ
pictures only the end of the fruitless and severed
branches, as a warning to the disciples; he does
not declare that this fate actually impends over
any truly new-born soul. Hence we cannot deduce
from his language the conclusion of Meyer
and Alford that the verse involves the possibility
of falling from grace. The whole teaching is
full of warning to every one to make his calling
and election sure, not to rest in a “finished salvation;”
and in this it corresponds with the
uniform teaching of the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:12, 13; <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr>
4:11; 12:15; 2 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 1:10</span>). The admonition is somewhat
analogous to and may be interpreted by
that of Paul in <abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 5:6, 7, and <abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 3:5, an
admonition pertinent to all who substitute a
supposed faith in Christ’s perfect work for practical
obedience, a faith that works by love. Alford’s
interpretation “<em>burneth</em>, not is burned in
any sense of being consumed,” is a striking illustration,
such as Alford does not often afford, of
modifying the text to escape an unwelcome conclusion.
The verb (<span lang="el">καίεται</span>) is in the passive
tense, and the figure is certainly one of destruction,
not of torment. But it is not to be taken
literally. The essential truth which underlies
the metaphor is simply this, that the soul which
is separated from Christ is separated from the
source of spiritual life, withers away, and is
eventually destroyed. What is soul destruction
is a question not here considered.</p>

bear much fruit and shall become my

teaching, his commandments, revelations, promises;
to be accepted by obedience, faith, hope.
They are said to abide in the soul only as they
spring up and bear fruit in the life (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 13:8, 23</span>).
Thus to have Christ’s words abiding in us is the
same as to bear Christian fruit. To him who
thus abides in Christ and bears his fruit this
promise is made, analogous to and interpreted
by that of <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_13">14:13</a>, <a href="#ch14_14">14</a>. The prayers of those
who are thus pervaded by the spirit of Christ
are, like their Master’s, those of not merely a
humble submission to, but a supreme desire for,
the will of God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
6:9, 10; 26:39</span>).—&#8203;Hence in
answering them the Father is glorified. For the

always embrace a supreme desire for the Father’s
glory. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> Christ’s prayer in
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#CHAPTER_XVII">17</a>. Answer
to such prayers is given that the praying
Christian may both bear much fruit and become
a disciple; both fruit-bearing in the life and docility
of spirit, <i>i. e.</i>, both practical obedience to
Christ and the spiritual capacity to appreciate
Christ’s instructions, are the result of this life of
prayer, and are a divine answer to prayer. The
translation given in the English version, <cite>so shall
ye be my disciples</cite>, is possibly legitimate, but
it reverses the true order of the spiritual life, by
representing that fruit-bearing is the condition of
becoming a disciple of Christ; and the other
construction is both more in harmony with the
general teaching of the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> and also with the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
original here. <em>That</em> (<span lang="el">ἵνα</span> is <dfn>telic</dfn>) is equivalent to
<em>in order that</em>, but the meaning is not that God is
glorified for the purpose of perfecting Christian
character, but that prayer in the name and spirit
of Christ is answered for that purpose.</p>

<p><b>9-11. As the Father hath loved me, so
have I loved you. Abide ye in my love.</b>
<em>As</em> indicates the quality and character of the
love. Christ’s love for the disciples is, like the
Father’s love for Christ, a love personal, warm,
strong; but one that does not shield from all
temptation, suffering, or even injustice. The
word rendered <em>continue</em> in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch15_9">9</a> is the same rendered
<em>abide</em> in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch15_7">7</a>. <em>My</em> love is Christ’s love
for us, not our love for him. The meaning then
is, I have loved you with the love which the
Father has for me; so live as to retain this love.
And the next sentence indicates how this is to
be done.—&#8203;<b>If ye keep my commandments ye
shall abide in my love, even as</b>, etc. On
the meaning of the word <dfn>keep</dfn>, see
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch14_21">14:21</a>,
note. The commandments are all summed up
in the one command, “Follow me,” and this
again is interpreted by the command, “That ye
love one another as I have loved you.” Love is
the key to Christ’s character; to love is to follow
Christ. A life of asceticism or of retirement
and meditation is not the way to this indwelling
with Christ. The condition is love in activity of
service; a love and life like that of Christ,
which was neither one of asceticism nor one of
repose.—&#8203;<b>These things have I spoken unto
you that my joy might remain in you,

<a href="#ch16_1">16:1</a>, <a href="#ch16_4">4</a>, <a href="#ch16_33">33</a></span>) is that he may
perfect in them and in us that Christian joy
which is one of the fruits of the Spirit (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 5:22;
<abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 14:17</span>), joy in the Lord, <i>i. e.</i>, in his companionship,
in fulfilling his will, in suffering with
and for him, in doing his service (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 5:41; <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr>
2:17, 18; 4:4</span>); the joy which Christ sets before
himself, and for which he endured the cross,
despising the shame (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 24:26; <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 12:2</span>). By
<dfn>my joy</dfn> is meant, not joy concerning Christ, nor
joy derived from Christ, nor joy of Christ himself
in us, his disciples, though this last is a possible
interpretation, but his own joy, <i>i. e.</i>, joy
like his, having the same source in God and the
same quality, enduring and invincible. And if
this joy is in the soul, the soul is <em>full</em>; it leaves
nothing to be desired. In words there is, in experience
there is not, a contradiction in the implication
that he who was a man of sorrows and
acquainted with grief was also one possessing
the most radiant joyfulness. This promise of
joy, uttered by Christ just before Gethsemane
and Calvary, is itself a song in the night, and a
promise of one to every Christian soul in its own
passion hour.</p>

the commandment which he has before given,

of that commandment, in order that he may
guard them and us against that Pharisaic obedience
of external rules which selfishness and
earthliness are continually substituting for a spiritual
obedience to the one interior law of Christian
character, self-sacrificing love.—&#8203;<b>Greater
love hath no one than this, that one lay
down his life for his friends.</b> Beware of
reading this as though laying down the life were
equivalent to dying. To die for a friend is not
the greatest manifestation of love; to live for
him, by consecrating the whole life to him, is
far greater. See <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch10_11">10:11</a>,
<a href="#ch10_17">17</a>, notes.—&#8203;As
Christ consecrates not only his earthly life, but,
in his intercession with us and for us, his eternal
life, to his friends, so, if we are his friends, we
shall lay down our lives for him, not necessarily
by dying for him, but by doing whatsoever he
commands us, that is, by living for him. Thus
Christ points out at once both the perfection of
his love for his disciples and the perfection of
that love which he desires from his disciples.
He does not here say, however, that to lay down
one’s life for one’s friends is the highest manifestation
of love; still higher is that manifestation
made by laying down the life for enemies.

<p><b>16. Ye have not chosen me, but I have
chosen you and ordained you.</b> Primarily
the reference is to the choice of the twelve from
among the disciples of Christ to be witnesses
and apostles (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 6:13;
John <a href="#ch6_70">6:70</a>; Acts 9:15</span>); and
this choice did not prevent one of them from
becoming an apostate. It is Christ who chooses
for each one of us his place and work in life.
That this is the primary meaning is evident, not
only from the parallel language employed in the
passages above cited, but also from the second
clause of the verse here. The word rendered
<cite>ordained</cite> is literally <dfn>placed</dfn>; and that is the meaning
in this passage: I have chosen you and appointed
you your place in life. So in Acts 13:47;
20:28; 1 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 2:12. But it is also clear
from the language of <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch15_19">19</a>, <cite>I have chosen you
out of the world</cite>, that Christ refers not merely to
a choice of the twelve from among the whole
discipleship for a particular work, but also to a
choice of them from the world to be followers
of him. And as an historic fact, so far as we
know the history of the twelve, each one was
first called by Christ. See for example <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
9:9; Mark 1:16-20; John <a href="#ch1_43">1:43</a>. The vine
precedes the branches; the first life flows from
the vine into the branches; the first choice is the
choice of the dead soul by the living Christ, not
the choice of the living Christ by the dead soul.
We love him because he first loves us (<span class="muchsmaller">1 John 4:10,
19; <abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 2:4, 5</span>), and choose him because he first
chooses us. And, however difficult it may be
for us to reconcile this truth with our <i lang="la">a priori</i>
conceptions of divine impartiality, rightly held
it is an inspiration to Christian activity and a
source of Christian humility. “Even when this
doctrine of election has taken a narrow <span style="white-space:nowrap;">form—even</span>
when it has been recognized chiefly as <span style="white-space:nowrap;">exclusive—it</span>
has had a mighty power over the
hearts of men. They have given themselves up,
as they never could do when they thought they
had selected their own destiny, or were going on
errands of their own. But when it takes the
form it has here *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* there cannot be any
principle which is at once so humbling and so
elevating, which so takes away all notion from
the disciple that there is any worth in his own
deeds or words, which gives him so confident an
assurance that God’s word, spoken through him
or through any man, will not return to Him
void.”—(<cite>Maurice.</cite>)—<b>That you should go and
bring forth fruit, and that your fruit
should remain.</b> They were chosen that they
should go forth as apostles, everywhere carrying
the gospel of reconciliation, and bringing back
to their Master the fruits, in sinners converted
and saints edified. So every Christian is chosen
that he may go forth out of himself, out of a life
of mere personal enjoyment of religion, and
bring forth fruit that shall abide in other lives
after his life comes to its close. And he is
bound to take heed that both in his life (<span class="muchsmaller">2 John,
<abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 8</span>), and in other lives (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 14:13</span>), there is fruit
that abides unto life eternal.—&#8203;<b>That whatsoever
ye shall ask of the Father in my
name, he may give it you.</b> Both clauses of
the verse are dependent on the general declaration,
“I have chosen you.” For analogous construction,
see <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch13_34">13:34</a>.
Christ chooses his
disciples that they may go out into the world
and bring forth much fruit, and also that they
may ask of the Father in his name what they
need; that is, both for a life of Christian activity
and of Christian devotion. And the one is necessary
to the other. The Christian brings forth
much fruit only as he has power in prayer, the
power of a faith that God is able to do much in
and through him (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 4:13</span>); and he has power
in prayer only as he brings forth much fruit (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch9_31">9:31</a>; <a href="#ch14_7">14:7</a></span>). Besser notes an evidence of emphasis
which Christ lays upon prayer in the fact that
prayer in the name of Jesus is urged in all three
chapters of this farewell discourse.</p>

<p><b>18-21.</b> From this point to the end of the
chapter Christ passes to speak of the relation of
the disciples to the world, and continuing the
theme in the next chapter, points out
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch16_1">16:1-4</a></span>)

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
the particular manifestation of the world’s enmity
which the disciples may expect.—&#8203;<b>If the
world hates you, know that it hated me
before you.</b> <dfn>The world</dfn>, in John’s use of the
term, signifies the unspiritual portion of mankind,
those who have not been taken out of an
animal and sensual condition by being born
from above. See for illustration of his meaning
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch1_10">1:10</a>,
<a href="#ch1_29">29</a>; <a href="#ch3_16">3:16</a>;
<a href="#ch4_42">4:42</a>; <a href="#ch12_31">12:31</a>, etc. Many
in the visible church may be of the world; some
without the visible church may not be of the
world. It was the church which most bitterly
hated Christ; the publicans and sinners were
drawn to him, and their enthusiasm for him was
his protection against the machinations of the
hierarchy (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 12:12; Luke 20:19; 22:2</span>). Christ does
not assert that the world will necessarily hate the
disciples. The disciple’s life may be so ordered
of God that it is never brought into direct
collision with the self-interest, the pride, and the
ambition of the world. But if the collision does
arise, and the disciple suffers the world’s enmity,
he is to be strengthened and comforted by
the reflection that that has befallen him which
previously befel his Master. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch7_7">7:7</a>,
where Christ declares that the world cannot hate
those that act in accordance with worldly policies
and principles, and 1 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 4:12, 13; 1 John
3:13, 14; 4:4, 5, where the apostles employ the
same consideration employed by Christ here,
and for the same purpose. It is better to take
<em>know</em> as an imperative than as an indicative, as
an exhortation than as a mere statement of a
fact. It is thus analogous to <em>remember</em> in
<abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch15_20">20</a>.—&#8203;<b>If ye were of the world *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* because
ye are not of the world.</b> The Christian
is <em>in</em> but not <em>of</em> the world, because he is
born from above (<span class="muchsmaller">John
<a href="#ch3_3">3:3</a></span>), and so is made a
member of a kingdom which, like its king, is not
of this world (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch8_23">8:23</a>; <a href="#ch18_36">18:36</a></span>).—&#8203;<b>Therefore the
world hateth you.</b> Not merely because the
disciple is chosen by Christ, but because he is
chosen out of the world, and by his life of nonconformity
bears a perpetual testimony against
the world. This enmity is illustrated by the
case of Daniel (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Daniel">Dan.</abbr>
6:1-5</span>), Peter and John (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts
4:21</span>), and Christ himself
(<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch11_49">11:49</a>,
<a href="#ch11_50">50</a></span>). It is
aroused whenever Christian principle comes into
collision with worldly interests.—&#8203;<b>Be mindful
of the word which I said unto you.</b> Bear
it in mind as a talisman in time of persecution.
See marg. ref. This truth, employed here and in
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 10:24 for encouragement,
is assigned in <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch13_16">13:16</a> as a reason for humility.—&#8203;<b>If they have
kept my saying they will keep yours also.</b>
This is not to be regarded as ironical, as rendered
by Grotius, nor is the word <cite>keep</cite> to be rendered
<dfn>watch</dfn> with a hostile intent, a forced meaning
given to it by Bengel, nor is the language
merely general and hypothetical, which is apparently
Meyer’s interpretation. Some will
persecute, others will accept and carefully keep,
the gospel. The disciple must anticipate both
results, persecution and glad reception. So it
was in Paul’s experience (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 13:42, 45, 48, 50; 14:4; 17:4,
5, etc.</span>). The most popular preachers are also the
most reviled and persecuted, from the days of
Christ down through those of Luther and Whitefield,
to the present day.—&#8203;<b>They will do unto
you for my name’s sake.</b> As the name of
Christ inspires the Christian with peculiar courage
and devotion, so it incites in his enemies
peculiar hostility. The fact that this hostility is
directed against Christ, and that in enduring it
the disciples are suffering for Christ and in his
stead, gives them peculiar strength and joy in
their sufferings (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 5:41; 21:13; <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 5:3; 2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr>
11:23; 12:10, 11; <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:17, 18; <abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 6:14; 1 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 4:12, 13</span>).

of <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:11, 12.—&#8203;<b>Because they know not

<p><b>22-25. If I had not come *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* they
had not known sin.</b> The meaning is not,
They would not have had <em>the</em> sin of hating me
without a cause; there is no definite article
attached to the word <cite>sin</cite>; the declaration is
general, as it is rendered by our English version.
Moreover, to say that men would not have been
guilty of the sin of hating Christ if Christ had
never come to their knowledge is to utter the
merest truism. This, though it is the common
interpretation, and is adopted, though not defended,
by such scholars as Meyer and Alford,
seems to me utterly untenable. Nor is the
meaning, They would not have had so great sin;
Christ often uses metaphor, <em>but he never exaggerates</em>.
By his death the Lamb of God has taken
away, not some sins from the world, but <em>the sin
of the world</em>. See <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_29">1:29</a>, note. Hence the only
sin for which men are condemned is that of deliberately
rejecting the offer of free forgiveness
and a new life through Jesus Christ
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch3_18">3:18</a>, <a href="#ch3_19">19</a>,
notes</span>). Other sins are not reckoned against them
(<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 17:30; <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 3:25</span>). They are judged by Christ,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
because they are judged worthy of life if they
accept his free offer of it, and unworthy of life
if they put it away when it is offered to them
(<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 13:46</span>). Hence those to whom Christ has
been offered are not condemned because of their
past sins, which are freely forgiven; they are
measured by their acceptance or rejection of
Him. “No man shall die in his sins, except him
who through unbelief thrusts from him the forgiveness
of sin, which in the name of Jesus is
offered to him. This is the real sin which contains
all others. For if the word of Christ was
received every sin would be forgiven and remitted;
but since men will not receive it, this constitutes
a sin which is not to be forgiven.”—(<cite>Luther.</cite>)—<b>But
now they have no cloak for
their sin.</b> No cover or excuse. Ignorance is
an excuse; but when the offer of pardon and a
new life is refused, the sin is shown to be deliberately
chosen. Every man naturally seeks an
excuse for his sin (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 3:12, 13</span>). Christ takes
away every excuse and leaves the sinner, at the
judgment day, to the sentence of condemnation.
“I would *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* but ye would not” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
23:37</span>).—&#8203;<b>He that hateth me hateth my Father
also.</b> Because Christ is the manifestation
of the Father, therefore anti-Christ is anti-God.
See <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch8_42">8:42</a>.—&#8203;<b>If I had not done among
them works which none other did.</b> Not
merely <em>miracles</em>; the whole life-work of beneficent
activity is that which attested to the Jews
Christ’s character; and the whole work of beneficent
activity wrought by him in the church
universal is the ever-living testimony to the divine
nature and authority of Christianity. The evidence
of a divine redemption through Jesus
Christ is cumulative; and the sin of hating
Christ, as embodied in Christian principles,
truths, and lives, is consequently continually
enhanced.—&#8203;<b>They have both seen and hated
both me and my Father.</b> This was literally
true in respect to the hierarchy at Jerusalem,
who even as these words were spoken were plotting
with Judas for the arrest and execution of
Christ. They determined to slay him, because
in no other way could they countervail his wonderful
works (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch11_47">11:47-50</a></span>).—&#8203;<b>They hated me
without a cause.</b> See <abbr title="marginal reference">marg. ref.</abbr>
The language
was employed by the original <span style="white-space:nowrap;">author—whether</span>
David or not is not quite <span style="white-space:nowrap;">certain—not</span>
with any distinct understanding of its prophetic
significance. It is here applied by Christ to
himself, not by an accommodation, but because
all godly suffering in the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> was itself a type
of the great sacrifice for God and man consummated
by the cross of Christ, as all suffering in
the Christian church fills up what is lacking of
that sacrifice to perfect the world’s redemption
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 1:24</span>).
“These (<span class="muchsmaller">verses
<a href="#ch15_21">21-25</a></span>) are perhaps the
most terrible words in the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> or the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
No descriptions of divine punishment which are
written anywhere can come the least into comparison
with them for awfulness and horror.
This gratuitous hatred, this hatred of Christ by
men because they hate God, this hatred of God
because he has manifested and proved himself
to be love, is something which passes all our
conception, and yet which would not mean anything
to us if our conscience did not bear witness
that the possibility of it lies in ourselves.
Do not let us put away that thought, brethren,
or the one which is closely akin to it, that such
hatred is only possible in a nation which, like
the Jewish, is full of religious knowledge and of
religious profession.”—(<cite>Maurice.</cite>)</p>

The Comforter whom Jesus sent at the day of

who ever proceeds from the Father. Christ
attributes all blessed redemptive influences in
the last instance to his Father; as he is himself
from the Father, so the Spirit is from the
Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch7_29">7:29</a>; <a href="#ch8_26">8:26</a>,

the scholastic period of theology.—&#8203;<b>He shall

double testimony to the truth of Christianity,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
the spiritual and the historical. After Christ’s
death and resurrection the Spirit made clear to
the apostles the meaning of the enigma, interpreted
the prophets to them, and opened unto
them the true nature of Christ’s spiritual kingdom,
that they might testify unto others (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts

apostles also testified to the facts which they
had themselves witnessed in the life, death, and
resurrection of Christ, as evidences of his Messiahship
(<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 1:22; 3:15</span>). But, secondarily, every
Christian is a witness of Christ by his own life
and conversation, testifying things which in his
own experience he has both seen and heard; and
the Spirit of truth bears witness both in him and
through him to the power of God in a devout

The object of Christ’s teaching in these chapters
is not merely to impart consolation to the apostles
in their impending sorrow in his death, but
to impart strength to his disciples throughout
all time in their experience of temptation.—&#8203;<b>They
shall put you out of the synagogues.</b>
Excommunicate you. This was not in that age
a mere ecclesiastical censure; it involved the
most serious consequences, in exclusion from all
business and secular relations with men. See <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch9_22">9:22</a>, note.—&#8203;<b>Yea, the hour cometh that
whosoever killeth you will think that he

by Saul of Tarsus (<span class="muchsmaller">see Acts 25:9</span>), and by the proverb
found in the Rabbinical books, “Whoever
sheds the blood of the impious does the same as
if he had offered a sacrifice;” not less illustrated
by the history of religious persecutions,
in which the persecutor has very generally believed
that by slaying the heretic he was appeasing
God’s wrath against the community and the
church. Such an experience, if it came without
forewarning, would endanger their faith. “It
would be a strange result; fellowship with their
brethren destroyed because they proclaimed the
ground of fellowship; death inflicted upon them
because they preached that death was overcome.
Might not poor Galileans, conscious of folly and
sin, often say to themselves: ‘We must be
wrong; the rulers of the land must be wiser
than we are. Ought we to turn the world upside
down for an opinion of ours?’”—(<cite>Maurice.</cite>)
This is always a temptation in times when Christian
principle seems counter to public sentiment,
a temptation not merely to abandon Christian
principle in order to conform to public sentiment,
but to think the principle which commends
itself to so few and arouses the hostility
of so many cannot be sound. [The Greek student
will find in Alford’s and Meyer’s interpretation
of <span lang="el">ἵνα</span>, <dfn>that</dfn>, a curious illustration of the
straits to which the commentator is put who
insists on giving it always its accurate (<dfn>telic</dfn>),

uninstructed by a measurably correct conception
of God becomes itself an instigator of the most
remorseless cruelty. The cause of the wrong is
in not receiving as a little child the teaching of
Christ, and even of nature (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:45</span>), respecting
the comprehensiveness of the Divine love. All
intolerance is rooted in self-worship, making a
god of our own self-will.—&#8203;<b>But these things
have I told you that when the hour has
come ye may call to mind these things,
that I have told you them. But these
things I have not told you from the beginning,
because I was with you.</b> What
are <em>these things</em>? Most commentators understand
Christ to refer to his prophecies in verses <a href="#ch16_2">2</a> and
<a href="#ch16_3">3</a>, and they understand his meaning to be, <dfn>I have
forewarned you of those persecutions, that when
they come upon you you may remember that I did

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
forewarn you of them</dfn>. But this interpretation is
not consistent with the added words, <cite>These
things I have not told you from the beginning</cite>;
for the prophecies of future perils which threatened
them are quite as clear in <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 10:17-22,
28; Mark 13:9-13; Luke 21:12-17, as they
are here. Meyer and Godet even suppose that
Matthew has inserted the warnings in his Gospel
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 10</span>) out of their place, taking them from
Christ’s discourse here; and the explanations
given by other commentators, if they violate the
text less, violate its meaning more. Luthardt
gives them all briefly. <em>These things</em>, I think, are
not merely the prophecy of the persecutions
which are to fall upon the disciples; they are
the whole comforting and inspiring instructions
of this discourse respecting the person, advent,
presence, and indwelling grace and power of the
Spirit of Truth and Holiness. The phrase is
used here as in <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_25">14:25</a>; <a href="#ch15_11">15:11</a>,
<a href="#ch15_17">17</a>; <a href="#ch16_1">16:1</a>, <a href="#ch16_6">6</a>.
Combining these verses, we get Christ’s object
in this whole instruction in the truth of the Divine
Immanence, namely, that the disciples may
be prepared for the progressive teaching of the
Spirit of Truth; that their Master’s joy in the
Holy Spirit may be theirs, and so their joy may
be full; that their lives may abound in the fruits
of a love that is nourished only by the indwelling
of the Spirit; that in trial and persecution they
may not be offended and induced to abandon
faith in him as their Master; and he urges them
when this trial hour comes upon them to recall
to mind this teaching respecting the indwelling
and ever-abiding Comforter, teaching not given
before except in hints and suggestions, rudimentary
and fragmentary, because while he was
yet with them in the flesh they could and notably
did depend upon him.</p>

<p><b>5, 6. But now I go away.</b> Not <em>my way</em>;
the idea of departure simply is conveyed by the
original.—&#8203;<b>And no one of you asketh me,
Whither goest thou? but because I have
said these things unto you sorrow hath
filled your heart.</b> The first clause is not literally
true. Peter directly, Thomas indirectly,
had asked, Whither goest thou? (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch13_36">13:36</a>; <a href="#ch14_5">14:5</a></span>).
It is to be interpreted by the latter clause. The
meaning is, Instead of turning your thoughts
towards me and my future glory, and asking
after my Father and my home, which you would
do with rejoicing if you loved me supremely
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_28">14:28</a></span>), your thoughts are on your own loneliness
in the future when I shall have left you,
and because of it sorrow has completely filled
your heart, that is, to the exclusion of every
other thought. My words should bring you
comfort; they bring you pain. There is a pathetic
reproach in Christ’s language, easily comprehended
by every pastor who has attempted
to point sorrowing souls to the invisible world,
only to see their grief burst out afresh at the
awakened recollection of the earthly loss. Notice,
your <em>heart</em>, not hearts; the singular is used,
as in <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 1:21, because they are so thoroughly
a unit in their common feeling of sorrow. Stier
notices the contrast between the experience of
these same disciples now and at the subsequent
parting at the ascension: “These are the same disciples
who afterwards, when their risen Lord had
ascended to heaven, without any pang at parting
with him, returned with great joy to Jerusalem
(<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 24:52</span>).” A practical lesson to every mourner
here, as in <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch14_28">14:28</a>, is that he should not allow
a selfish sorrow to fill his heart so completely
that he cannot follow in his thoughts the loved
one to his heavenly home.</p>

</div>

<p><b>7. Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it

The original is stronger than our English version;
the implication is plainly, as Alford gives
it, “that the dispensation of the Spirit is a more
blessed manifestation of God than was even the
bodily presence of the risen Saviour,” and the
reasons why it is so are intimated in previous
parts of this discourse. See especially <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_16">14:16</a>, <a href="#ch14_17">17</a>,
notes.—&#8203;<b>For if I go not away the
Comforter will not come unto you.</b> He
does not say will not come, but will not come
<em>unto you</em>. Hitherto the Spirit had been given
only to men especially fitted by their spiritual
nature to receive its teachings and to become in
turn teachers to others. After the death and
resurrection of Christ the Spirit was given to the
church universal, to all believers. See Acts 2:8.
The language therefore does not prove, according
to Alford, that “the gift of the Spirit at and
since Pentecost was and is something totally distinct
from anything before that time.” The
difference consisted in its universal bestowal,
whereas before it was limited to a few. Why
could not the Spirit be sent until Christ had first
gone away? Because it is impossible for men to
live at the same time by faith and by sight. So
long as the disciples had a visible manifestation
of God with them, they would not and could not
turn their thoughts inward to that more sacred

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
but less easily recognized manifestation which
could not be seen, and therefore could be known
only by spiritual apprehension.</p>

<p><b>8. And coming, that one shall convince
the world respecting sin and respecting
righteousness and respecting judgment.</b>
In this and the three succeeding verses Christ
describes briefly the office and work of the Holy
Spirit. As the advent of Christ was itself a
preparation for the dispensation of the Spirit,
and as in his departure he points his disciples to
the indwelling of that Spirit as the source of
their hope, their joy, their love, their entire
spiritual life, these verses, in which he points out
specifically the manner in which the Spirit will
develop this spiritual life, may be regarded as
the heart of this discourse. To attempt to give
the various opinions of conflicting commentators
on this passage would almost inevitably
entangle the mind of the student in a mesh
of contradictory interpretations, and would obscure
rather than clarify the meaning. I have
therefore, with Alford, “preferred giving pointedly
what I believe to be the sense of this most
important passage, to stringing together a multitude
of opinions on it, seeing that of even the
best commentators no two bring out exactly the
same shade of meaning, and thus classification
is next to impossible.” Much depends on the
right reading of the five words rendered in our
English version <em>reprove</em>, <em>world</em>, <em>sin</em>, <em>righteousness</em>,
and <em>judgment</em>, and I believe that very much of
the difficulty in interpretation has grown out of
imputing to these words a theological and scholastic
meaning instead of taking them according
to their most simple and natural meaning. (1)
The word <em>reprove</em>, which I have rendered <dfn>convince</dfn>,
properly signifies to convince one of truth in
such a way as to convict him of wrong-doing.
It is rendered <dfn>tell</dfn> him his <em>fault</em>
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 18:15</span>); <em>reprove</em>
(<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 3:19;
John <a href="#ch3_20">3:20</a></span>); <em>convict</em>
(<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch8_9">8:9</a></span>); <em>convince</em>
of sin (<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch8_46">8:46</a>;
1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 14:24</span>); <em>rebuke</em> (<span class="muchsmaller">Titus
2:15; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 3:19</span>). Here, then, the meaning is that
the Holy Spirit will so bring to the world’s consciousness
the spiritual truths respecting sin,
righteousness, and judgment that the world will
stand self-convicted. (2) <em>The world</em> is here, as
always with John, the great mass of humanity,
not necessarily excluding believers, but in contrast
with the distinctive body of believers.
This world cannot receive the Spirit of Truth,
for it seeth him not, neither knoweth him
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_17">14:17</a></span>). Nevertheless it is this unseen and unknown
Spirit who can alone convince and convict
the world. The disciples “are to despair of its
ever coming from them; they are to be sure it
will come from the Spirit with which He will
endue them. Not they, but He, will convince the
world; because, though the world may not receive
Him neither know Him, it has been formed
to receive all quickening life from Him; it must
confess His presence, even if it would hide itself
from His presence.”—(<cite>Maurice.</cite>) (3) <dfn>Sin</dfn> is primarily
a miss or wandering, but in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
only in a moral sense, that is, a wandering or
turning away from the line of truth and righteousness.
It is the first office of the Holy Spirit to
show the world how this turning away from
righteousness is the great folly, the mistake in
comparison with which all other mistakes are as
nothing (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Proverbs">Prov.</abbr> 1:32; 8:36</span>). (4) <dfn>Righteousness</dfn> is primarily
rectitude, uprightness, perfectitude of
character. John’s use of the term is indicated
by his employment of it in 1 John 2:29; 3:7, 10,
“He that doeth righteousness is righteous.” To
understand the language here to refer to any doctrine
of an imputed or transferred righteousness is
to import into the simple language of the Master
theological ideas born of scholasticism and belonging
to a later date. The meaning is that he
who convicts the world of having departed from
righteousness will also bring to the world’s consciousness
a realization of the elements of true
righteousness of character. (5) <dfn>Judgment</dfn> is primarily
moral discrimination, whether exercised
by God or man; its use, to signify a tribunal,
whether human (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:21, 22</span>) or divine, as in the
frequent use of it to signify the day of judgment
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 12:42; Luke 10:14; <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 9:27</span>), is secondary. John
always uses it in the primary sense of moral and
spiritual discernment, except in 1 John 4:17,
where he defines his meaning by employing the
phrase <cite>day of judgment</cite>. The third truth of
which the Holy Spirit will convince the world
will be the true divine canons of moral judgment.
The general declaration, then, is that
the Holy Spirit when he comes will convict the
world, by bringing to its spiritual consciousness
the truth respecting sin, or wandering from
God and his law; righteousness, or the divine
ideal of character; and judgment, or the true
principles of spiritual discrimination.</p>

<p><b>9-11. Concerning sin, because they have
not had faith upon me.</b> <em>Because</em> indicates,
not the reason why the Spirit shall convince of
sin, but the nature and evidence of the sin itself.
It may be rendered <em>in that</em>. The meaning is not,
The Holy Spirit will convince of sin because they

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
have not had faith, but, That they have sinned
in that they have not had faith. The fact
that the character of Christ does not call forth
the moral and spiritual affections of the soul
is the strongest evidence of that soul’s insensibility;
and the fact that the offer of free
pardon and the impartation of a new spiritual
life is not accepted, demonstrates that continuance
under condemnation and in sin is the soul’s
free choice. Thus the sin of the world both consists
in and is demonstrated by its rejection of
Christ (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch3_18">3:18-21</a></span>); not by any intellectual opinion
entertained respecting him, but by the lack of
spiritual appreciation and the failure to give to
him and his teaching the welcome of an affectionate
and obedient faith.—&#8203;<b>Concerning righteousness,
because I go away to my Father
and ye see me no more.</b> Christ is himself
the ideal of human character, the divine righteousness
interpreted by a human life. But this
righteousness was not, and could not be, comprehended
while Christ still lived in the flesh
among men. The eyes of men were fastened
upon the apparent ignominy of his position and
circumstances, and the divine love which is interpreted
to us by his humiliation was to his
contemporaries obscured by it. It was necessary
that he should go away to his Father before
the world could begin to appreciate the sacred
meaning of a life which was so wholly laid down
for others. So, habitually, the world learns the
meaning of a life after it has ended, and honors
after death those whom it has despised while
living, and forgets after death those whom it has
honored while living. The Holy Spirit convinces
the world respecting true righteousness of character,
by spiritually interpreting to it, through
the ages, the glory of one who could only be understood
after he had gone away to the Father
and the world saw him no more. To appreciate
his righteousness they must look on him by faith
and not by sight. The more common explanation
(see <cite>Godet</cite> and <cite>Meyer</cite>) that he who was put
to death as a sinner was proved to be righteous
by his resurrection and ascension is inadmissible,
because Christ here says nothing of his resurrection
or his ascension; he uses the same phraseology
which he has previously employed in this
discourse in speaking of his death
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch13_33">13:33</a>, <a href="#ch13_36">36</a>;
<a href="#ch14_28">14:28</a>; <a href="#ch16_5">16:5</a></span>);
and because he adds emphasis to
the truth that it is his <em>departure from them</em>, not
his visible exaltation or ascension to which he
refers, by adding to the words “because I go to
my Father” the explanatory clause “and ye see
me no more.”—&#8203;<b>Concerning judgment, because
the prince of this world is judged.</b>
<abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> John <a href="#ch12_31">12:31</a>.
In the history of the race,
the methods, principles, and policies of the world
and its prince are being perpetually tried and
perpetually proved false by their results. Thus
the world and its prince are ever being judged,
and humanity, by the progressive teaching of the
Holy Spirit, interpreting the book of God’s Providence,
are being taught the divine canons of
moral and spiritual judgment. This work is
represented here, as in <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch12_32">12:32</a>, as being completed
in the death of Christ (<span lang="el">κέκριται</span>, perf.),
because the crucifixion of Christ, the consummate
work of the Evil One, was at once his
apparent victory and his real defeat. In the
crucifixion he pre-eminently had his own way,
and by the crucifixion he is defeated throughout
the ages. Thus it is in and by the cross that he
is pre-eminently judged. On the phrase <cite>prince
of this world</cite>, see John <a href="#ch12_31">12:31</a>;
<a href="#ch14_30">14:30</a>; and <abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 2:2. Interpreting it to mean Christ is
contrary to all <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> usage. In all this threefold
work the Holy Spirit glorifies Christ
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch16_14">14</a></span>); it
convicts the world of sin, by showing what a
Saviour it has rejected; it teaches the world of
righteousness, by showing the world in Christ
the divine ideal of sanctified humanity; and it
educates the world in judgment, by the perpetual
contrast between the policies of the world
and the enduring and peace-bringing principles
of Christ, demonstrating in the cross that the
weakness of Christ is stronger than the strength
of Satan, and the defeat of Christ is a victory
over Satan. See 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 1:23-25.</p>

<p><b>12. I have yet many things to say unto
you, but ye cannot bear them now.</b> This
was Christ’s last conference with his disciples,
and in his interviews with them after the resurrection
he added very little to the instructions
previously given to them. Clearly, therefore,
he here implies a progressive teaching to be afforded
by him through the Spirit to the church
in the future ages. It is of this future teaching
he speaks in this and the next three verses.
These truths the disciples could not then bear,
that is, <em>lift up and take away with them</em> (<span lang="el">βαστάξω</span>),
because they had not yet the mental and spiritual
strength. Among the truths which were
thus too much for them, and which were mercifully
concealed from their knowledge, was the
long period which must intervene before the
spiritual work of the church could be completed
and the world be ready for the Second
Coming of its Lord. Christ’s language clearly
implies that he held back phases of truth for

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
which his disciples were not ready, and thus
affords a clear example and divine authority for
the religious teacher, who may never suppress
the truth because it is <span style="white-space:nowrap;">unpopular—this</span> Christ

under the image of a guide conducting a traveler
in an unknown country. This country is truth.”—(<cite>Godet.</cite>)
This guidance is given to the church
throughout all ages, leading them by gradual
processes into ever higher and broader conceptions
of divine truth.—&#8203;<b>For he shall not speak
from himself.</b> <em>From</em> (<span lang="el">ἀπό</span>) marks the remote
or ultimate origin or cause. As Christ traces all
the source of his own authority back to the
Father, who dwelleth in him (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch5_19">5:19</a>, <a href="#ch5_30">30</a>; <a href="#ch7_28">7:28</a>;
<a href="#ch14_20">14:20</a></span>), so he traces back to the same source the
authority of the Holy Spirit. Thus he guards
his disciples against that subtle tritheism which
regards the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
as practically three deities. See <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch15_26">15:26</a>. Both
the Son and the Spirit take those things which
they receive of the Father and give to the believer,
and the object of their ministry is to bring
the believer into fellowship with the Father.—&#8203;<b>And
he will show you things to come.</b>
Rather <em>the coming things</em>. As the coming one
(<span lang="el">ὁ ἐρχόμενος</span>) (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
3:11; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 1:4</span>) is the Messiah,
and as the coming world (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 10:30</span>) is the Messiah’s
kingdom, so the coming things (<span lang="el">τὰ ἐρχόμενα</span>)
are those things which are connected with the
future advent and the final kingdom of the Messiah.
The Holy Spirit shall not merely bring all
things which their Lord has taught them to the
disciples’ remembrance
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_26">14:26</a></span>), but shall also
teach them concerning the things of the future;
he shall inspire their hope as well as clarify their
memory. This promise of Christ was primarily
fulfilled in the prophetic hopes and anticipations
inspired in the early church, and in the prophetic
character given to many of the apostolic utterances,
<i>e. g.</i>, <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 11:25-32; 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 15:50-53;
1 <abbr title="Thessalonians">Thess.</abbr> 4:13-18; Titus 2:11-14. But this office
of the Spirit was not consummated in apostolic
times; those who submit themselves to his guidance
and instruction will still press forward
toward the mark for the prize of the high calling
of God in Christ Jesus, ever looking for that
blessed and glorious appearing of the great God
and our Saviour Jesus Christ. “He will not
allow us to be satisfied with our advanced knowledge
or great discoveries, but will always be
showing us things that are coming; giving us an
apprehension of truths that we have not yet
reached, though they be truths which are ‘the
same yesterday, to-day, and forever.’”—(<cite>Maurice.</cite>)</p>

<p><b>14, 15. He shall magnify me.</b> That is,
the office of the Spirit shall be to magnify
Christ, his character, his work. See above on
verses <a href="#ch16_9">9-11</a>. Any pretended dispensation of the
Spirit which draws the thought of the world
away from Christ to some other and independent
authority is spurious, whether it be that of ecclesiastical
tradition as of the Church of Rome, or
that of the mysticism which substitutes an inner
light for the word and authority of Christ, or that
of spiritism, introducing in lieu of that word
communications with the spirit world. That only
is the message of the Holy Spirit which tends to
magnify Christ.—&#8203;<b>He shall receive of mine,
and shall it show unto you.</b> To receive of
Christ (<span lang="el">λαμβάνω</span>) is to accept, acknowledge, and
follow his instructions as a teacher. This use of
the word is especially marked in John’s employment
of it in respect to Christ, <i>e. g.</i>, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_12"> 1:12</a>;
<a href="#ch5_43">5:43</a>; <a href="#ch13_20">13:20</a>. The declaration, then, is that the
Holy Spirit comes not to gainsay or cancel, and
not even, in strictness of speech, to add to the
instructions of Christ, but to accept them, and
accepting, interpret them, giving to them in the
future apprehension of the church a profounder
significance than they had or could have in the
apprehension of his own contemporaries.—&#8203;<b>All
things that the Father hath are mine;
therefore said I</b>, etc. We are not, however,
to imagine that Christ’s teaching is confined to
the words uttered by him in the flesh and reported
to us in the Gospels. All things that the
Father hath are his; the book of nature and the
book of Providence are his as truly as the spoken
and reported word. And in receiving and spiritually
interpreting the testimony of nature and
life, the Holy Spirit is receiving from him and
showing to us. If we understand his teaching
aright, we shall always see in it Christ magnified.</p>

<p>In these verses (<span class="muchsmaller">7-15</span>) Christ points out more
specifically than he has previously done to his
disciples, and through them to us, the office of
the Holy Spirit and the nature of his dispensation.
It is for our benefit that the manifestation

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
of God in the flesh and to the sense has ceased,
in order that the inward manifestation to the
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">faith—profounder</span>, broader, and more <span style="white-space:nowrap;">universal—may</span>
take its place. This invisible but indwelling
Spirit comes that he may teach the world
the reality and greatness of its sin, the true conception
of righteousness, and the canons of a
divine spiritual discernment. This work of the
Spirit is a perpetually progressive work, guiding,
by successive steps, the church into the
way of all truth. In it the Spirit speaks from
and by authority of the Father, and concerning
the future, turning the thoughts of the believer
ever toward a larger knowledge and a higher
and diviner life; albeit in all he acts not as a revealer
of a new Gospel, but as an interpreter of
the teachings of Christ, in the written word and
in all the things of God, in nature and life,
which are themselves the things of Christ; so
that the dispensation of the Spirit is not an addition
to but an essential part of Christianity, the
revealing in its fullness to the ever-growing
spiritual apprehension of the church the truth
of and from Christ.</p>

Luthardt, and Tischendorf, queried by Lachmann,
retained by Godet. But the fact that the
phrase reappears in the disciples’ expression of
their perplexity, in the next verse, seems to me
to furnish very nearly conclusive evidence that
it belongs here. Those who omit it here suppose
that the disciples put with what he has just now
said, what he had previously said in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch16_10">10</a>. Observe
the contrast between the first and second
seeing; two different verbs are both rendered <dfn>see</dfn>;
the one signifies properly an external perception
by the senses; the other is also used to indicate
a mental or spiritual perception, and that
appears to be its meaning here. In a little
while Christ should be no longer visibly present
with his disciples; a little while more, and, in the
dispensation of the Spirit inaugurated at Pentecost,
they should again perceive him by spiritual
apprehension. It is evident that Christ does not
refer to his Second Coming, both because he
changes the form of the verb, so indicating another
and unsensuous seeing, and because not a
little but a long while was to elapse between the
departure of the Lord and his Second Coming.</p>

<p><b>17-19.</b> The disciples, however, had no other
thought of any second advent of their Master
than that in which they should sensuously see
as well as spiritually perceive him. They therefore
ask among themselves what he means by
this distinction between <em>seeing</em> and <em>perceiving</em>
him. Their difficulty was the same as that previously
expressed by Judas, with the analogous
declaration of Christ that he would manifest
himself to them (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_22">14:22</a></span>). It was enhanced by
Christ’s statement that this new manifestation
to the spirit should be in a little while; for in
his discourse on the Last Day (<span class="muchsmaller">see <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 24, notes</span>)
he had plainly implied that a long interval of
trial and persecution must intervene before his
Second Coming in power and glory. They therefore
inquire in whispers of one another what he
means by this, “<cite>Ye shall not see me, and ye
shall perceive me</cite>,” and what by “<cite>A little
while</cite>.” Their fear to ask Christ is one of the
many indications of the peculiar awe which his
presence inspired in them; their love was reverential,
not familiar; the love of a child for an
honored teacher, not that of an equal (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 9:32;

words are used to express the same substantial
idea; not to convey different shades of meaning,
but to give emphasis, and to indicate the largeness

the disciples. <dfn>To weep</dfn> (<span lang="el">κλαίω</span>) is a general word

<b>21, 22. A woman when she brings forth
hath sorrow.</b> The figure of a woman in travail
is used in the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> to illustrate sudden and
great anguish (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 21:3; 26:17; 66:7; <abbr title="Hosea">Hos.</abbr> 13:13; Micah
4:9, 10</span>). Christ lays hold upon this familiar
figure and gives it a new signification, indicating
that the pain is but a preparation for and a presage
of a greater joy. And this is generally the
<abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> use of the figure (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 24:8, note; <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:22</span>).
The contrast is an instructive illustration of the
difference between the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> and the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> We
are not mystically to interpret the figure here by
saying that the travail of the Son of God was
necessary in order to bring the Messiah forth as
a King and lawgiver. However true this may
be, it is not the truth here enforced. Christ
speaks not of his own suffering for sinners, but
of the suffering of the disciples in and because
of him; and this suffering he declares will be
forgotten when it has accomplished its purpose
and brought forth its fruits in and for them.
See the same general truth illustrated by <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr>
5:3-5; <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 12:11. Observe that, as above,
the sorrow is not merely displaced by joy, but is
<em>turned into joy</em>; the travail is not merely followed
by gladness, but brings forth that which
is the cause of the gladness. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> <abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:18,
where the glory is represented as revealed in us
because of the sufferings, and <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 12:11,
where the fruits of chastening are promised only
to those that are “exercised thereby.” <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 7:14.—&#8203;<b>I will see you again, and your

shall see me again. He is speaking not of his
second and visible coming, but of his spiritual
and invisible presence. His words are interpreted
to us by history, and the distinction between
the two is plain; to the apostles they
were not so interpreted, and upon the traditional
report of such words as these the apostolic
church may have built its hope of Christ’s
Second Coming in their own time. <cite>I will see you</cite>
expresses Christ’s sympathy for his church in
all their experiences, whether of joy or sorrow.
See <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 1:12, 13; 2:1. He weeps with those
that weep, and rejoices with those that rejoice;
not a hair of the head perishes, not a sparrow in
the church falls without his knowledge. <cite>Your
heart shall rejoice</cite> foretells such experiences as
those of Peter and other apostles (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 5:41</span>), Stephen
(<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 6:15</span>), Paul and Silas (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 16:25</span>), etc.—&#8203;<b>And
your joy no one taketh away from

<a href="#ch15_11">15:11</a></span>), a joy
in God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 3:1; 4:1</span>), which is <em>in</em> the new-born
soul, not merely given <em>to</em> it, and therefore cannot

<p><b>23, 24. And in that day ye shall inquire
nothing of me. Verily, verily I say unto
you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father
he will give it to you in my name.</b> In our
English version two different Greek words are
rendered by the word <em>ask</em> in this verse, suggesting
a contrast which does not exist in the original.
Christ does not distinguish between two
epochs in Christian experience; in the earlier and
more imperfect one prayer being offered to
Christ, in the later and perfected one prayer
being offered directly to the Father. He specifies
two distinct blessings which shall attend
upon the dispensation of the Holy Spirit. The
disciples, perplexed by Christ’s enigmatical language,
had desired but feared to ask an explanation
(<span class="muchsmaller">verses <a href="#ch16_17">17</a>,
<a href="#ch16_18">18</a></span>). Christ tells them that when
the Holy Spirit shall have come with his illuminating
and quickening influences, they shall no
longer be perplexed by truths which now they
cannot understand. In that day they shall no
longer need to interrogate him for an interpretation.
Then he adds that this dispensation shall
be one of great power in prayer: Whatsoever ye
shall request the Father he will give it you.
“There is not in this verse a contrast drawn between
asking <em>the Son</em>, which shall cease, and
asking <em>the Father</em>, which shall begin; but the
first half of the verse closes the declaration of
one blessing, namely, that hereafter they shall
be so taught by the Spirit as to have nothing
further <em>to inquire</em>; the second half of the verse
begins the declaration of a new blessing, that
whatsoever they shall <em>seek</em> from the Father in
the Son’s name, he will give it them.”—(<cite>Trench.</cite>)
And in fact one of the first and most notable influences
of the descent of the Spirit was to
make clear to the minds of the apostles those
spiritual truths concerning the character of
Christ and his kingdom which had theretofore
been hidden from their eyes. And ever since,
growth in spiritual life has made clear sayings
which are dark and incomprehensible to the unspiritual.
The reading, <cite>He will give to you in my
name</cite>, is preferable to the reading of the Received

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
Text, <cite>Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name</cite>,
(<cite>Tischendorf</cite>, <cite>Meyer</cite>, <cite>Alford</cite>.) But the fact that
the Father gives in the name of Christ, by whom
He made, sustains, and governs the world (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr>
1:16-20; <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 1:1, 2</span>), and through whom all his
redeeming love is manifested to his earthly children,
presupposes that they present their requests
through him as their Mediator, that is,
in His name.—&#8203;<b>Until now ye have asked
nothing in my name; ask and ye shall
receive, that your joy may be full.</b> Not
until the descent of the Holy Spirit did the disciples
recognize Christ as a Divine Mediator and
Intercessor. Prayer out of Christ is offered to a
God from whom the soul is separated by a consciousness
of sin (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 59:2</span>). Such prayer is often
one of wrestling and of anguish; and the deeper
the consciousness of sin the greater the mental
and spiritual stress. Christ lays emphasis here
upon the fact that his disciples are to pray in his
name, that is, standing in his stead, the prophecies
of the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> fulfilled and their sins and iniquities
blotted out as a thick cloud (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 44:22</span>),
and they themselves brought into filial relations
with the Father, reconciled unto God, and receiving
the Spirit of Adoption whereby they cry
Abba Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:15</span>). Thus prayer, which in
the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr> was often characterized by fear and
wrestling (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 18:27, 30, 32; <abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> 32:31, 32; Psalms 42, 43</span>),
is in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> almost always characterized by
joy and thanksgiving (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 3:14-21; <abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 1:9, 12;
2 <abbr title="Thessalonians">Thess.</abbr> 1:11, 12</span>). In the reading of this direction
of Christ respecting prayer we are to interpret
the direction to ask in Christ’s name and the
declaration that the Father will give in Christ’s
name by the experience of the apostolic church,
who did all things in the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ (<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch20_31">20:31</a>;

<a href="#ch16_21">16:21</a>. But he foretells a time in
which these spiritual truths shall be spiritually
revealed (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 2:9, 10</span>). “The entire human language
is a parable, as it does not admit of adequate
expression concerning some things. The
Lord therefore contrasts with the use of this
feeble medium of communication the employment
of one more internal and more real. By
the impartation of his Spirit, the Lord teaches
the knowledge of the nature of God freely and
openly (<span lang="el">παῤῥησίᾳ</span>), without
any fear of a misunderstanding.”—(<cite>Olshausen.</cite>)—&#8203;<b>At
that day ye
shall ask in my name; and I say not to
you that I will request the Father on your
behalf, for the Father himself loveth you,
because ye have loved me and have had
faith that I come from the presence of the
Father.</b> Or <em>from God</em>; there is some uncertainty
as to the reading. Christ does not say
that he will not request the Father on behalf of
his disciples; but if we take the whole sentence
in its connections he does clearly teach, not only
that no intercession is required to win the love
of the Father, but also that they who have loved
Christ, and have spiritually recognized the divine
life manifested in him, are thereby brought into
direct personal communion with the Father, and
need no intercessor. “While their hearts are
the temples of the Holy Ghost and they maintain
communion with the Father they will need no
other advocate; but ‘If any man sin we have an
advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous’
(<span class="muchsmaller">1 John 2:1</span>).”—(<cite>Watkins.</cite>) Beware of supposing
that this passage impliedly teaches that
the Father’s love depends on the prior faith and
love of the disciple. The contrary doctrine is
abundantly taught in the Bible, and nowhere
more clearly than in the writings of John
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch3_16">3:16</a>; 1 John 4:9, 10, 19</span>). But love has many inflections,
and the fullness of the Divine love is possible
only to those who by love and faith enter
into the adoption of the children of God. The
love of the father to the prodigal in the far country
is not the same as the love to the same son,
clothed and in his right mind, sitting at his
father’s board.</p>

<p><b>28.</b> “This verse,” says Bengel, “contains the
most important recapitulation;” “a simple and
grand summary of Christ’s entire life, his origin,
his incarnation, and his destiny,” Meyer calls it.
It is this, but also more than this. The disciples
have believed that Christ came from the Father;
Christ seizes on this belief that he may awaken
their hope by leading them to see that in going

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
from the world he must return to the Father.
Thus he leads back their minds to the declaration,
“If ye loved me ye would rejoice because
I go unto the Father”

<p><b>29, 30.</b> These verses clearly show a change
in the spirit of the disciples. They had begun
the supper by a contention for the first place at
the table. They had almost scouted at Christ’s
prophecy of their desertion (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:33-35</span>). The
questionings of Thomas, Philip, and Judas
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_5">14:5</a>, <a href="#ch14_8">8</a>,
<a href="#ch4_22">22</a></span>) indicate not only perplexity, but a
state of semi-skepticism, removed from absolute
disbelief on the one hand and from unquestioning
faith on the other. This spirit is abated as
the conference proceeds, and it is because the
disciples are ashamed to confess it that they
question with bated breath among themselves
the meaning of his words, “A little while and
ye shall not see me, and again a little while and
ye shall perceive me” (<span class="muchsmaller">verses
<a href="#ch16_17">17-19</a></span>). Now they declare
their doubts allayed; there is no need to
question him further; they are convinced that
he knows all things; they are willing to take his
declarations without questioning; this absolute
credence they declare as the evidence of their
faith that he came forth from God. They do
not profess fully to understand their Master, only
fully to believe him. Augustine’s remark, therefore,
is more epigrammatic than just: “They so
little understand that they do not even understand
that they do not understand. For they
were babes.”</p>

<p><b>31, 32. Do ye now believe?</b> Most of the
commentators take this affirmatively, <em>Ye do now
believe</em>, and the original is capable of either construction.
Our English version seems to me
preferable. Christ does not indeed deny their
faith, but he questions it, that he may lead them
to question themselves. He cautions them that
their faith in his divine origin, sweet as it may
be to them in this hour of quiet conference, is
not sufficiently strong to stand in the hour of
treachery, peril, and death. So many a disciple
has had faith in divine principles and truths in
the hour of his quiet meditation upon them,
which he has deserted when holding fast to
them would involve suffering.—&#8203;<b>And ye shall

<p><abbr title="Chapter">Ch.</abbr> 17:1-26. CHRIST’S INTERCESSORY PRAYER.—&#8203;<span class="smcap">His
prayer of preparation for the Passion.—&#8203;His
prayer of intercession for his church.—&#8203;His
mission and its fulfillment.—&#8203;The mission of his
followers.—&#8203;His fourfold petition for them:
preservation; consecration; sanctification;
glorification.</span> See on <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch17_24">24</a>.</p>


<p><a id="Note_ch17"></a><span class="smcap">Preliminary Note.</span>—We rightly hesitate to
analyze or criticise any prayer; the language of
devotion is too sacred. How much more when
the prayer is the intimate communing of the
only begotten Son with his Father, a prayer
which no soul can ever comprehend, and none
can therefore ever interpret. Nevertheless, it
would not have been recorded if it had not been
intended for our profit; and it can only be for
our profit as it is made the theme of our reverent
study. In this exposition of it I avoid as far as
possible verbal and textual criticism, giving results
rather than discussions. These the student
can find in other commentaries, especially Tholuck
and Meyer. For the same reason I eschew
theological polemics. Socinian, Arian, and
Trinitarian have fought over the words and
phrases of this sacred prayer, each, and perhaps
the one not more than the other, evolving from
it arguments for his philosophy of the character
of Christ, and of life here and hereafter. Into
such conflicts I have no heart to enter. The
student will find them indicated, and even illustrated,
in Alford. I have sought by meditation

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
to enter into the spirit of this, the most sacred
utterance of our Lord, and I seek with simplicity
to aid others in meditating upon it; if through
such meditation the spirit of the believer is
brought into unity with the Spirit of his Lord, it
is enough. The prayer is not didactic; certainly
not dogmatic. The office of public <span style="white-space:nowrap;">prayer—and</span>
by giving to his church a record of this prayer
our Lord has made it <span style="white-space:nowrap;">public—is</span> not to teach a
system of theology, but to deepen the springs of
spiritual life, by leading the sympathetic soul
into the presence of God. This prayer has a
twofold aspect. It is a revelation of the communings
of the only begotten Son with the Father;
it thus presents to the church Christ as
the Son and Intercessor, pleading for his church,
and shows us what are his most secret and sacred
desires for us. These are four: election
out of the world and preservation from its evil;
sanctification and consecration unto and in the
truth; the perfect unity of love, in God and
with one another; and spiritual appreciation of
and participation in the glory of the Father and
the Son in the eternal life. But since we are all
brought through Christ into the adoption of the
sons of God, this prayer is also an example and
inspiration for us. It is, in a sense, Christ’s second
and fuller answer to the request of his
church universal, “Lord, teach us how to pray.”
The Lord’s prayer is given at the outset of our
Lord’s ministry to those who are just learning
the Fatherhood of God. This prayer of intercession
is given at the close of our Lord’s ministry,
to those that had learned from him both
what were their own wants and what their
heavenly Father’s grace had provided for them.
The former is the model for the universal
church, young and old in Christian experience;
the latter is an inspiration to those who, through
the teachings of their Lord, have come into fellowship
with God and his Son Jesus Christ. It
is not without significance that it follows close
upon the teaching that Christ is the vine and we
are the branches, that we see the Father in seeing
the Son, that after Christ is gone and is seen
no more, he will yet be really present and spiritually
perceived, and that we are to ask in his
name of the Father, who has himself loved us.
It is thus the Holy of Holies to which the preceding
instructions have been as outer courts
conducting us. The key to its true interpretation
I believe will be found in two facts: (1) that
it immediately precedes and is a spiritual preparation
for the impending Passion, which in a
measure the disciples shared with their Master;
and (2) the only glory which the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> recognizes
is a glory of <em>character</em>, not of circumstance
or condition. Thus Christ’s prayer here is that
he may be sustained by divine grace in the hour
of trial, so that the character of the Father may
be manifested by him in his patient fidelity to the
end, and that, through his example and his Father’s
influence, his disciples may be made like
the Father and like the Son in the glory of their
love. See further on <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_1">1</a>.</p>

<p>There is some question whether we have the
exact words of the Lord or no. Alford goes
beyond the declaration or even clear implication
of the sacred narrative, in saying, in opposition
to Olshausen and the German commentators
generally, that we have here “the very words of
our Lord himself, faithfully rendered by the
beloved apostle, in the power of the Holy
Spirit.” We can only say that the Lord has just
promised his disciples that the Holy Spirit will
bring all things to their remembrance which he
has said to them (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_26">14:26</a></span>); that on no heart
would these sacred words be more deeply impressed
than on that of the apostle who was
leaning on Jesus’ bosom at the supper; that we
cannot conceive any utterance in the rendering
of which that promised inspiration would be
more likely to be sought by John and vouchsafed
by the Lord; and that if we cannot be
sure that we have the very words of our Lord,
we can be sure that no modern commentator has
the right to sift out the prayer and tell us what
were Christ’s words and what were the Evangelist’s.
That the Holy Spirit did not consider
the very words essential to our profit is evident
from the fact that, while the prayer was almost
certainly in Hebrew, John’s record is in Greek,
and our version of it is in English; but that we
have in these words the very spirit of the prayer,
expressed as the Holy Spirit would have it expressed
for the guidance and inspiration of the
church universal, is as certain as the doctrine of
inspiration itself.</p>

<p><b>1-3. And lifted up his eyes to heaven.</b>
See <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch11_41">11:41</a>,
note. This is not an indication
that he and his disciples had gone out from the
chamber and were now in the environs of the
city, though Godet even undertakes to fix the
exact location: “Jesus had spoken the preceding

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
words on the road from Jerusalem to Gethsemane;
he was therefore on the point of passing
the brook of Kedron.” In fact, these words
indicate nothing as to locality. “The eyes may
be lifted to heaven in as well as out of doors;
<em>heaven</em> is not the <em>sky</em>, but the upper region,
above our own being and thoughts, where we
all agree in believing God to be especially present,
and which we indicate when we direct our
eyes or our hands upward. The Lord, being in
all such things like as we are, lifted up his eyes
to heaven when addressing the Father.”—(<cite>Alford.</cite>)—<b>And
said, Father.</b> Not <em>our</em> Father,
for Christ never identifies himself with his disciples;
nor <em>my</em> Father, for that would too strongly
emphasize the separation between him and
them; without identifying himself with his disciples,
he yet uses language on which their
spirits too can ascend towards God.—&#8203;<b>The hour
is come.</b> The hour of the Passion, to which
all prophecy had pointed, for which all the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>
dispensation had prepared, and from which all
redemptive influences proceed. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
26:45; Mark 14:41; John <a href="#ch7_30">7:30</a>; <a href="#ch8_20">8:20</a>, etc.—&#8203;<b>Manifest
thine own Son in his glory, that
thy Son also may manifest thee in thy
glory.</b> The changed position of the words, in
the two clauses, in the original (<span lang="el">σοι τὸν υἱὸν</span> in the
first clause, <span lang="el">υἱὸς σοι</span> in the second), justifies the
rendering <dfn>thine own Son</dfn>. <dfn>To glorify</dfn> (<span lang="el">δοξάζω</span>) in
<abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> usage nearly if not quite always signifies
to <em>manifest</em> glory. The authorities which Robinson
(<abbr title="Lexicon"><cite>Lex.</cite></abbr>, <span lang="el">δοξάζω</span>) cites in justification of the
definition to <em>make glorious</em> are at best of doubtful
interpretation. The glory of Christ is his self-sacrificing
love. The noblest manifestation of
this glory is his patient and peaceful endurance
of the Passion. In the cross of Christ alone
would Paul glory (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 6:14</span>); it is the Lamb slain
that is the glory of heaven (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 5:6</span>). Christ
here prays that the Father will so enable him to
endure the cross that it may become glorious,
and so a manifestation of the Father’s glory; it
is Jesus Christ “lifted up” who draws all men
unto him, and this in order that through him
they may be drawn to the Father. He prays
that every knee may bow and every tongue confess
him Lord, but only to the glory of God the
Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:11</span>). Throughout this prayer the
thought is always the same; glory is of character,
not condition; the glory of a divine love
manifested in self-sacrifice; making the Son
worthy to receive the peculiar love of the Father;
making all that, through Christ, become
partakers of the same divine nature, participators
also in the same divine love, sons of God, and
therefore one with the Father and with his Son.—&#8203;<b>Inasmuch
as thou hast given him power
over all flesh, in order that</b> (for the very
purpose that) <b>unto the all which thou hast
given to him, to them he should give
eternal life</b>. Maurice’s criticism on our English
version is just: “Our translators would
have appeared to themselves and to many of
their readers to be using an uncouth and strange
form of speech, if they had rendered the words
literally. But I think they were bound to encounter
any apparent difficulty of construction,
rather than to incur the risk of contracting or
perverting the sense.” Christ has authority (the
original implies both <em>power</em> and <em>authority</em>; see
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch1_12">1:12</a>, note) not merely over all mankind, but
over all terrestrial life and the earth itself, the
abode of flesh and the realm of his redemptive
work (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 1:14-18</span>); but this authority and power
is conferred upon him by the Father
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch5_19">5:19</a>,
<a href="#ch5_30">30</a></span>)
for a purpose, namely, that out of the world he
may gather a kingdom, receiving the entire body
which God has given to him, and conferring on
each individually, in that body, eternal life.
Thus here, as in <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch6_37">6:37</a> (<span class="muchsmaller">see note there</span>), Christ
speaks of the <em>all</em> (<span lang="el">πᾶν</span>, neuter singular) as given
to him in a body by the Father, but of <em>each one</em>
as receiving individually (<span lang="el">αὐτοῖς</span>)
the special, personal gift of eternal life.
Observe on the one hand that Christ declares
himself, by implication, Lord of all, not of Jews,
or elect, or Christendom merely; but on the
other hand he also declares, by implication, that
not all will receive from him the gift of life eternal.
There is implied a redemption universal in
its offer, but not in its results. The <em>whole</em> is
given to him, but only that he may impart eternal
life to the <em>chosen</em>. Who are thus chosen is
indicated in <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch6_40">6:40</a>, namely, every one that
seeth (spiritually) the Son and hath faith in him.
Because the Father has thus conferred divine
authority on the Son, for the work of redemption,
the Son pleads with the Father to so carry
him through the Passion hour that this redemptive
work may be consummated and eternal life
imparted to the believer. Beware of reading
<em>eternal</em> life here as equivalent to <em>everlasting</em> life or
<em>age-abiding</em> life. The duration is merely incidental;
spiritual life <em>is</em> everlasting; but that which
is essential is its spirituality, not its endurance.
The nature of this life is indicated in the next
sentence.—&#8203;<b>But this is eternal life, that they
may know thee the only true God, and
him whom thou hast sent forth, Jesus the
Messiah.</b> <cite>That</cite> (<span lang="el">ἵνα</span>) cannot here be rendered
<dfn>in order that</dfn>, and curiously both Alford and
Meyer, who insist that it is always <em>telic</em>, <i>i. e.</i>, always
signifies intention, here render it without
that signification. “This knowledge of God
here desired <em>is</em> the eternal life” (<cite>Meyer</cite>); “<em>is</em>,
not is the way to” (<cite>Alford</cite>). Spiritual knowledge
and spiritual life are in so far the same that
neither is possible without the other. We become
like God only as we know him (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 3:18;</span>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
<span class="muchsmaller">1 John 3:2</span>); we know him only as, becoming like
him, we become sharers of his life (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:8; John
<a href="#ch3_3">3:3</a>; <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 12:14; 2 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 1:5-9</span>). For this knowledge
(<span lang="el">γιγνώσκω</span>) is not intellectual understanding of
the truth about God, but a personal and spiritual
acquaintance with him; it is not psychological,
but sympathetic. See <abbr title="Jeremiah">Jer.</abbr> 9:24; <abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr>
3:19; <abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 3:10; <abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 8:2. The connecting
particles are important. Christ prays
that the Father will glorify him in the approaching
Passion, in order that he may be able to give
eternal life to those whom the Father has given
to him, for this life can be given only by giving
them a true apprehension of the one God, and
he can be made known to them only through
him whom he hath sent into the world, Jesus
the Messiah. The knowledge of the only true
God is in contrast with polytheistic paganism;
knowledge of Jesus as the Messiah is in contrast
with Jewish pride and prejudice. The first was
the burden of Paul’s preaching at Athens; the
second of Peter’s preaching at Jerusalem (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts
2:22-36; 17:22-34</span>). The use of the third person
here, and the phrase Jesus Christ, often found
together in the Epistles, but never in Christ’s
previous discourses, have been cited by rationalistic
critics as an evidence that this prayer was
the work of a later writer, who with doubtful
dramatic license put it into the mouth of Christ.
The answer is (1) that the time had now come
for Jesus to declare in unmistakable language
his Messiahship, and that no more natural or
suitable form could be employed than that of
such a prayer; (2) that the very fact that the
names appear so frequently in conjunction in
the Apostolic writings, and in the early church,
is itself a reason for believing that the apostles
derived them from their Master.</p>

<p><b>4, 5. I have manifested thy glory on the

the Passion of the next twenty-four hours.
<abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> Paul in 2 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 4:7, “I have finished my

glory in and with thee, that glory which I have
always possessed</em>. The word <cite>glorify</cite> is used
throughout this prayer, I believe, always with
the one signification, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, to show forth glory,
not to confer it (<span class="muchsmaller">see on <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_1">1</a></span>), and that the glory of

<cite>I have had</cite> (<span lang="el">εἶχον</span>, imperfect) is, as above
rendered, equivalent to <dfn>always</dfn> or <dfn>habitually had</dfn>.
The language <cite>before the world was</cite> clearly implies
Christ’s pre-existence with the Father
from the creation of the world. It is not, and
by no candid interpretation can be made, the
language of a merely human experience. God
is said to have chosen his saints (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 1:4</span>), but
not to have loved and glorified them, from before
the beginning of the world; but Christ’s
grace was prepared and his glory was manifested
before the foundation of the world (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 1:17;
2 <abbr title="Timothy">Tim.</abbr> 1:9; Titus 1:2</span>). Christ declares that he has
manifested the glory of the Father by the fulfilling
of the Father’s work thus far; and he
prays the Father to remember the glory of love
which bound the Son and the Father together
in the eternal life of the past, and to so sustain
him in the trying experiences of the present,
that this divine glory, which he has had with the
Father from before the beginning of the world,
may be made manifest.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> Christ here passes from the prayer for himself
to the intercessory prayer for his disciples,
with whom, by the request in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_20">20</a>, he includes
all who have faith in him, through all time.—&#8203;<b>I
have manifested thy name unto the men
whom thou entrusted to me out of the
world. Thine they were, and thou entrusted
them to me; and they have guarded
thy teaching.</b> To <dfn>manifest</dfn> is literally to
cause to shine (<span lang="el">φανερόω</span>, from <span lang="el">φαίνω</span>). The name
that was enveloped in darkness, of him whom no
one by searching can find out, who was, and
apart from Christ ever is, the unknown and unknowable,
Christ has made to shine forth out of
the darkness. The <em>name</em> represents all that
which lies back of and gives meaning to the
name, here the power and character of God. See
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 28:19, note. Especially his name of Father
Christ has made to shine out upon a before orphaned
world, both by manifesting in himself
the character of God the Father, and by his life,
and notably by this prayer, manifesting also the
relation which may and should subsist between
the children and the Father to whom Christ
gives access (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 5:2;
<abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 2:18; 3:12</span>). The verb
rendered <cite>gave</cite>, here and below (<span lang="el">δίδωμι</span>), is equally

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
capable of being rendered <dfn>entrusted</dfn> or <dfn>committed</dfn>
(<cite><abbr title="Robinson's Lexicon">Rob. Lex.</abbr></cite>). This is clearly its meaning in <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
16:19; 25:15; John <a href="#ch5_22">5:22</a>; and I think represents
the meaning here and in John <a href="#ch10_9">10:29</a> better
than the word <em>gave</em>. The Father entrusts his
children to the guardian keeping of his Son, but
will at the end receive them again unto himself
when the Son delivers up the kingdom to God,
even the Father (<span class="muchsmaller">1
<abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 15:24</span>). They were the
Father’s (<em>thine</em>) before they were entrusted to
the Son, not because they were Israelites; for
Christ includes all, Gentiles as well as Jews, in
this prayer, and elsewhere makes it clear that he
does not regard any one as of God because descended
from Abraham (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch8_37">8:37</a>, <a href="#ch8_39">39</a>, <a href="#ch8_40">40</a>; <abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> Luke
3:8</span>); nor because they were chosen by God from
the foundation of the world; for there is no
distinct declaration nor any necessary implication
of election, either absolute or conditional, here.
The disciple of Christ is the Father’s, because he
is born from above, by the Spirit of God, before
he can see the kingdom of God, certainly therefore
before by faith he can enter it. Thus he is
of the Father before he hears Christ’s voice; he
is given by the Father to the Son before he comes
to the Son (<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch3_5">3:5</a>;
<a href="#ch6_37">6:37</a>, <a href="#ch6_44">44</a>;
<a href="#ch8_47">8:47</a></span>). <em>Teaching</em> or
<em>word</em> (<span lang="el">λόγος</span>), a different Greek word from that
rendered <cite>words</cite> in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_8">8</a>, indicates the whole
system of divine truth entrusted by the Father
to Christ and by him taught to his disciples, and
pre-eminently that truth of God which was embodied
in the Son’s life and death even more
than in his verbal instructions (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch7_16">7:16</a>; <a href="#ch12_48">12:48</a>, <a href="#ch12_49">49</a></span>).
It is called the Father’s <em>word</em> or <em>teaching</em> because
the words of Christ were not his, but the Father’s
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_24">14:24</a></span>). To <dfn>keep</dfn> (<span lang="el">τηρέω</span>) is to guard
watchfully, as one guards a prisoner; it therefore
includes the idea both of watchful attention
to the word and solicitude to preserve it by obedience
in the life and heart (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch8_51">8:51</a>, note</span>). Christ
then declares that he has made luminous the
name of God, by interpreting the divine Fatherhood,
not to the whole world, but to those selected
out of the world and entrusted to his
guardian keeping; and that those thus entrusted
to him by the Father, to whom they owe the
first impulse of divine life that sent them to
Christ for light, have been attentive to hear and
careful to preserve the instructions they have
received from him. In the succeeding two
verses he indicates what was the heart of this
divine instruction.</p>

<p><b>7, 8. Now.</b> <em>Already</em>; the word is emphatic.—&#8203;<b>They
know.</b> <em>Assuredly know</em>; the perfect
tense has the present signification, but indicates
completed knowledge; not that the disciples
were perfect in knowledge of Christian truth,
but they were fully convinced of the fundamental
truth of Christianity, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, that it is a divine
revelation, not an earth-born and human philosophy.—&#8203;<b>That all
things whatsoever thou
hast entrusted to me are bestowed by
thee.</b> <cite>Are of thee</cite> (<span lang="el">παρὰ σοῦ ἐστεν</span>) signifies <dfn>bestowed
by thee</dfn>; the former is the more literal,
the latter is the truer translation, because it
renders the Greek idiom into its English equivalent
(see <cite><abbr title="Robinson's Lexicon">Rob. Lex.</abbr></cite>, <span lang="el">παρά</span>, I:2). Christianity is
a <em>gift</em> of the Father through Christ.—&#8203;<b>That the
words which thou hast entrusted to me I
have entrusted to them.</b> This clause, like
the preceding one, is dependent on the first
clause; the disciples have assuredly known that
whatsoever truths are possessed by Christ came
from the Father, and that whatsoever the Father
has entrusted to him he has in turn entrusted to
them, keeping nothing back for fear or favor.
<abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> Acts 20:20, 27. I see no reason for translating
the same Greek particle (<span lang="el">ὅτι</span>) <em>that</em> in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_7">7</a>, <em>for</em> or <em>because</em>
in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr><a href="#ch17_8">8</a>, first clause, and <em>that</em>
again in the last clause of the same verse. Christ
before spoke of <em>doctrine</em> or <em>teaching</em> (<span lang="el">λόγος</span>), <i>i. e.</i>,
the system as a whole; he now speaks of <em>words</em>
(<span lang="el">ῥήμα</span>), thus emphasizing the truth that each
specific word in his teaching, whether of promise,
commandment, or instruction, is from the
Father. These words were entrusted by the
Father to Christ, and now that Christ is about
to leave his disciples he entrusts these words in
turn to them, sending them forth, as he himself
was sent forth, to teach only what they are commanded.
See <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch17_18">18</a>;
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 28:20. He does not
merely give these words to us for our own behoof;
he entrusts them to us to be used for
others.—&#8203;<b>And they have received</b> (not <em>them</em>,
an addition by the translators which the context
does not warrant), <b>and known assuredly
that from thee I came forth</b>. They have
just declared their reception of this central truth
of Christianity, that Jesus Christ came forth
from the Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch16_29">16:29</a>, <a href="#ch16_30">30</a></span>). They not only
have known that Christ has taught only what the
Father imparted to him, <i>i. e.</i>, is a teacher sent
from God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch3_2">3:2</a>, note</span>), but they have gone on
from this <em>knowledge</em> to the spiritual reception <em>by
faith</em> of the truth that Christ himself has come
forth from the Father. Their faith has laid hold
on not only his divine teaching, but also his divine
character. Whosoever begins by accepting

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
Christ as a divine and authoritative teacher, and
holds fast to that faith, grows into the experience
of continuous acceptance of him in his person
and character as a manifestation of the
Father from whom not only the words, but he
himself, came forth.—&#8203;<b>And have had faith
that thou didst send me.</b> “<cite>That I came out
from thee</cite> is more a matter of conviction from
inference, hence <cite>they have known</cite>; whereas the
other side of the same truth, <cite>thou hast sent me
forth</cite>, the act of the Father unseen by us, is
more a matter of pure faith, hence <cite>they have had
faith</cite>.”—(<cite>Alford.</cite>)</p>

<p><b>9, 10. I am praying for them; I am not
praying for the world.</b> It is monstrous exegesis
to conclude from this that Christ never
prays for the world; he simply says, I am not
now praying for the world, but for my own disciples.
He enjoined on his followers to pray for
the unbelieving (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:44</span>); he prayed upon the
cross for them, “Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do” (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 23:34</span>); in this very
prayer, in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 23, he prays “That the world
may know that thou hast sent me,” etc. The
tense here is present, and the above translation
accurately represents the original. In asking for
those who have accepted him as a manifestation
of the glory of the Father, that they may be kept
even unto the end, he is praying for his own.
“The most he asked for the world is that it may
be converted, not that it may be sanctified or
kept.”—(<cite>Luther.</cite>) To the same effect are Godet,
Alford, Meyer, and the modern commentators
generally.—&#8203;<b>But for those whom thou hast
entrusted to me; for they are thine; and
mine all are thine, and thine mine, and
my glory is manifested in them.</b> <em>All</em> is
emphatic; the only begotten Son has nothing in
reserve from the Father. What Luther says is
true: “Any man may say, What is mine is thine,
but only the Son can say, What is thine is mine;”
nevertheless there are few that can utter with
the whole heart, and without any reserve, even
the first clause, “Mine <em>all</em> are thine.” Christ
pleads for his own on two grounds: (1) They
are the Father’s in the ownership of love; thus
the covenant mercy of God for his own is plead
as one ground of intercession. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> <abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 51:1;
69:13, 16. (2) They are entrusted to the Son’s
safe-keeping, and their preservation and sanctification
will manifest the Son’s glory, <i>i. e.</i>, the
glory of his redeeming love and power; thus the
Father’s love for the Son is plead as a second
ground of intercession. Thus also his example
indicates what it is to pray to the Father in the
name of the Son, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, in order that his glory of
redeeming love may be manifested. While this
declaration, “Mine all are thine and thine mine,”
is to be taken in its more comprehensive sense,
as indicating the unity of the Son and the Father
in all things, yet the context gives a peculiar and
spiritual significance to it. All that come to
Christ by faith, so becoming his, are born from
above and are the children of God; and all that
are truly born from above and are the children
of God come to Christ by faith, and so become
his (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>

going out of itself, imparting of itself to others,

guard with watchful care. See above on
<abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch17_6">6</a>.
<em>In</em> (<span lang="el">ἐν</span>) is instrumental; as the life of the flower
is preserved <em>in</em> the sunshine, so the life of the
soul <em>in</em> the name of the Father, in whom we live
and move and have our being. The <em>name</em> stands
here, as above (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 6</span>), for all which that name
represents: the paternal God. This name was
not <em>given</em> to Christ, he does not bear it; but it
was <em>entrusted</em> to Christ, that he might manifest
it to his disciples, by teaching them the Fatherhood
of God; and it is to this name that Christ
commends his disciples, for it is by faith in this
name, <i>i. e.</i>, in the essential fatherly character of
God, that the disciple receives the spirit of adoption
whereby he becomes a child of God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr></span>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
<span class="muchsmaller">8:15-17</span>), and it is this faith in his Father’s holy
keeping which is a shield to quench all the fiery
darts of the wicked (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr>
6:16</span>). <cite>In order that</cite>
may grammatically express either the object for
which the Father’s name was entrusted to Christ,
or the object of the holy keeping which Christ
seeks for his disciples. In fact, the object of the
manifestation and of the fatherly guardianship
is the same, namely, that the disciples who have
by faith received that name, and are protected
by it, may become partakers of the divine nature,
and so become one with the Son and the
Father, not only in general purpose, but in all
essential elements of character (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 12:10; 2 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr>
1:4</span>).—&#8203;<b>While I was with them I guarded
them in that name of thine which thou
didst entrust to me.</b> The reading here, as
above, is involved in some uncertainty, but this
is the better reading. The words <cite>in the world</cite>
are a gloss, and are needless.—&#8203;<b>And I preserved
them.</b> Our English version obscures
the meaning by rendering two different Greek
words (<span lang="el">τηρέω</span> and <span lang="el">φυλάσσω</span>) by the same English
word (<cite>keep</cite>) in this and the preceding verse.
Christ declares above that he has kept watch,
here that this watch has been successful, and
that he has <em>preserved</em> those over whom he has
watched.—&#8203;<b>And no one of them has destroyed
himself.</b> This, which is the sense of
the middle voice in Greek, it is important to preserve.
“Christ did not lose Judas, but he lost
himself.”—(<cite>Alford.</cite>) But the language implies
that every one might have destroyed himself but
for the guardian care of Christ.—&#8203;<b>Except the
son of destruction, that the Scripture
might be fulfilled.</b> See John <a href="#ch13_18">13:18</a>; Acts
1:20; <abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 41:9. It was predetermined, not
that one who might have been saved should destroy
himself in order to fulfill prophecy, but
that one who would destroy himself should be
among the twelve. Judas was not lured to destruction
in order to fulfill prophecy, but prophecy
was fulfilled in his self-destruction. See
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch19_28">19:28</a>, note. “Judas fell that the Scripture
might be fulfilled. But it would be a most unfounded
argument if any one were to infer from
this that the revolt of Judas ought to be ascribed
to God rather than to himself, because the prediction
laid him under a necessity. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Nor
was it the design of Christ to transfer to Scripture
the cause of the ruin of Judas, but it was
only intended to take away the occasion of stumbling
by showing that the Spirit of God had long
ago testified that such an event would happen.”—(<cite>Calvin.</cite>)
It is a noticeable fact that the phrase
<cite>son of destruction</cite>, here employed to designate
Judas, is employed by Paul in 2 <abbr title="Thessalonians">Thess.</abbr> 2:3 to
designate the Anti-Christ.</p>

<p><b>13-16. But now I am coming to thee.</b>
and therefore can no longer be an earthly guardian.
As a mother dying entrusts her children
to God, so Christ his disciples.—&#8203;<b>And these
things I speak in the world that they may
have my joy filled to overflowing in themselves.</b>
<cite>These things</cite> include not only the prayer
now offered for the disciples, but also the whole
course of instruction given to them and immediately
preceding the prayer. The object of
both instruction and prayer is the same, that his
disciples may be brought into that oneness with
the Father, that life in him, and that consequent
consecration to his will and service, which filled
the Son with an abiding peace and joy, and that
so they might be filled to the full with the same
joy. See <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_27">14:27</a>; <a href="#ch15_11">15:11</a>, notes.—&#8203;<b>I have entrusted
to them thy teaching.</b> Not <em>given</em>,
but <em>entrusted</em>. See above on
<abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch17_6">6</a>. The teaching
which the Father entrusted to the Son, the
Son in turn entrusted primarily to the apostles,
secondarily to his disciples throughout all time,
that they may become lights of the world as he
was the Light of the world, teachers of the truth
of God as he was the Great Teacher (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:14;
<abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 2:15</span>). That this is the meaning is indicated
by what follows. It is only as the disciples become,
by their life and words, teachers of the
truth, that the world hates them.—&#8203;<b>And the
world has hated them, because they are
not from</b> (<span lang="el">ἐκ</span>) <b>the world, in like manner as
I am not from the world</b>. The disciple of
Christ is born from above (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch3_3">3:3</a>; <abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 6:15; 1 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr>
1:3</span>), and thus is spiritually like his Master
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch8_23">8:23</a></span>). The origin of the divine life in Christ and
his followers is the same; in both it proceeds
from the Father.—&#8203;<b>I pray not that thou
shouldest take them from the world, but
that thou shouldest guard them from the
Evil One.</b> Not as Norton renders it, and as
our English version implies, from what is evil,
though that is included by implication; but from
the Evil One, <i>i. e.</i>, Satan. The original is, indeed,
capable of either meaning; but the latter

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
interpretation agrees best with John’s usage
elsewhere. See 1 John 2:13, 14; 3:12; 5:18.
The Evil One is treated by Christ as the source,
or at least the representative, of all that is evil,
as the prince of the kingdom of darkness and
sin. Compare <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 13:25, 38, 39, where the
tares, <i>i. e.</i>, the children of the wicked, are represented
as sown by the enemy, <i>i. e.</i>, the devil.—&#8203;If Christ does not desire for us that we should
be taken out of the world, we are not to desire
it for ourselves. Temporary retreat from the
world, the better to prepare us for it, is legitimate;
so Christ sometimes retreated, seeking
strength in solitude and communion with his
Father. But Christianity is not asceticism. The
disciple is sent into the world that he may be a
light to the world, and the measure of his Christian
life is not his experience in hours of retirement
from it, but the fidelity of his life in it.</p>

<p><b>17. Consecrate them in thy truth; thy
teaching is truth.</b> The original (<span lang="el">ἀγιάζω</span>) may
be rendered either <dfn>consecrate</dfn> or <dfn>sanctify</dfn>. It
means both to set apart from a common to a
sacred use, and also to make holy for that use;
in other words, it may mean to make holy in
<em>mission</em> or in <em>character</em>. But the former is evidently
the meaning here; for it cannot be said
that Christ made himself holy in character for
the sake of his disciples (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_19">19</a></span>). Christ prays
that the Father will set apart his disciples to a
life of divine service, as priests unto God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr>
20:6</span>). This consecration of the disciple involves
his sanctification; for the sinner cannot be set
apart to a holy work while yet in his sins. It
does not involve sanctification in the Son, because
he had no sins to be cleansed away. This consecration
of the disciple is effected both by imparting
to him through the Holy Spirit the truth
of God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_26">14:26</a></span>), and by commissioning him to
serve that truth by bearing witness of it unto
others (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 28:20; Acts 1:8</span>).
<cite>In thy truth</cite> (<span lang="el">ἐν</span>, dative)
expresses the idea that the truth is both
the instrument by which and the service to
which the disciple is consecrated. We are consecrated
unto the truth as we live <em>in</em> the truth;
so Samuel was consecrated to the temple by
being brought while yet a child to live <em>in</em> the
temple. Christ designates the teaching or word
which he has imparted, and which the Holy
Spirit will further impart to his disciples, <em>thy
teaching</em>, because all that comes through the Son
and the Spirit comes from the Father

<p><b>18, 19. In like manner as thou hast
sent me into the world, I also have sent
them into the world.</b> Full weight is to be
given to the phrase <em>as</em>, <i>i. e.</i>, <dfn>in like manner as</dfn>
(<span lang="el">καθὼς</span>). This is the most weighty and solemn
declaration of the mission of the disciple, I
think, in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>, albeit it corresponds with
the universal teaching of both Gospel and Epistle,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, that Christ is the first-born among
many brethren, and that those who are his disciples
are also to be <em>in all things</em> his followers;
like him <em>teachers of the truth</em>; like him <em>manifesting
the life and character of God</em> in the world, by the
divine life begotten in them from above; like
him <em>bearing the sins of others in their own person</em>,
and so filling up what is behind of the sufferings
Of Christ (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Philippians">Phil.</abbr> 3:10; <abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 1:24; 1 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 4:13</span>). Christ
does not merely <em>leave</em> his disciples in the world,
he <em>sends</em> them into it, as he was sent, each disciple
to be in his narrower sphere a saviour of
others, and the whole discipleship to be the
body of an ever living, ever incarnate, ever
teaching, and ever atoning Lord. Thus, too,
not only because they are <em>left alone</em>, but yet more
because they are <em>sent forth</em> to complete his work,
does the Son ask the Father to be to them what
he has been to their Lord in his earthly mission.—&#8203;<b>And
for their sakes I consecrate myself,
in order that they also might be consecrated
in the truth.</b> As above, both <em>in</em>,
<i>i. e.</i>, by means of, and <em>unto</em>, <i>i. e.</i>, to serve the
cause of the truth. The definite article is wanting,
and Meyer reads the phrase <cite>consecrated
in truth</cite>, as simply equivalent to “truly consecrated”;
but the other interpretation is warranted
by Greek usage, and better accords with
the context. While Christ identifies himself
with his disciples in his prayer that they may
become one with him, in his declaration that
they are in the spiritual life born of the same
divine Father, and in his commission to them to
carry out his work, he distinguishes between
himself and them; for he <em>consecrates himself</em>;
they must be consecrated by a higher power.
The consecration which the Lord made of himself
was not made, though it was consummated,
at Calvary. His death was a crowning act, not
the whole act. “Our Lord possessed a human
nature like our own, endowed with inclinations
and dislikes as our own is, though of such only
as are perfectly lawful. Of this nature he was
continually making a holy offering; he constrained
it to obedience; negatively by sacrificing

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
it when it was in contradiction with his mission;
positively by devoting to his divinely
appointed task all his powers, all his natural and
spiritual talents. It was thus that ‘He by the
Eternal Spirit offered himself without spot unto
God’ (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 9:14</span>).”—(<cite>Godet.</cite>) So also substantially

but also for those who have faith upon

is not general, <em>I am accustomed to pray for believers</em>,
but special, <em>It is for all believers that I
am now praying</em>. His intercessory prayer is for
us no less than for them.—&#8203;<b>That all may be
one; in like manner as thou, Father, in
me, and I in thee, that also they in us one
may be; that the world may have faith
that thou hast sent me.</b> The emphasis of
the Greek is partially represented in this nearly
literal rendering. Observe the close connection
with what has gone before. The burden of
Christ’s prayer has been that his disciples may
be preserved in the world, and consecrated for
their mission as truth-bearers to the world; he
now adds, I ask this in order that they may be
one in us. His prayer is not merely that they
may be one, but that they <em>may be consecrated in
and to the truth, so that they may become one</em>. The
implication is that whenever Christians are thoroughly
consecrated to the service of Christ all
differences so disappear that they work together
in unity of the spirit and of faith; and this truth
history abundantly confirms. This unity is not
in creed, ceremonial, or ecclesiastical organization,
but in the <em>Father and the Son</em>, <i>i. e.</i>, the
unity of personal devotion to, and love for, and
spiritual communion and fellowship with the
Father and his Son Jesus Christ (<span class="muchsmaller">1 John 1:3</span>). This
spiritual union in and with God will finally lead
to but it is not founded on unity in opinion. It
is a union that is apparent as well as real. The
world will see it, and seeing will be led to believe
that the Father has sent the Son, <i>i. e.</i>, that
Christianity is of divine origin, so marvellous
will seem to be the power of love uniting in one
kingdom elements, opinions, and nationalities so
diverse. This spiritual unity of the discipleship
of Christ is almost the consummation of Christ’s
prayer. He has only one higher request to prefer
for his church, namely, that through this unity
in him and the Father who has sent him, the
church may come to a true spiritual appreciation
of the Son’s eternal glory with and in the
Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>

is emphatic. The Father has given glory to the
Son; the Son makes all his followers participators
in that glory. In what does this glory consist?
Not in the power of working miracles
(<cite>Chrysostom</cite>), for this he has not given to all
those that believe in his name. Not the glory
of the heavenly state (<cite>Meyer</cite>), for this he <em>will</em>
give, but had not given to his disciples when he
uttered this prayer. Not the glory of unity with
the Father and the Son (<cite>Hengstenberg</cite>), for the
glory is given in order that this unity may be
attained; this unity with the Godhead is not the
glory, but the result of it. The glory which the
Father gave the Son was the glory of being the Son
of God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 3:17;
John <a href="#ch1_14">1:14</a>; <abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 1:5; 3:6</span>). This
glory Christ imparts to his followers, who
through him are received into the adoption of
God by faith, and become themselves sons of
God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch1_12">1:12</a>; 1 John 3:1</span>). And it is as we become
thus sons of God that we become one with each

only as we are united to one Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 8:29;
<abbr title="Ephesians">Ephes.</abbr> 1:10; 2:19</span>). This glory of sonship involves
not only filial relations with the Father, but the
possession of a divine life begotten by the Father,
and therefore a nature akin to that of the
Father, who is love, and whose children we are
only as we dwell in love (<span class="muchsmaller">1
John 3:9, 10; 4:8, 16</span>).—&#8203;<b>I
in them and thou in me.</b> And therefore
the Father in them through the Son, by whom
they have access to the Father.—&#8203;<b>That they
may be perfected unto unity.</b> This unity
of love with the Father and the Son, and therefore
with one another, is the culmination of the
divine life, as well as the disclosure of it. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>

“He demands with confidence as a Son, not as a

which are capable of being rendered <em>I will</em>; the
one (<span lang="el">βούλομαι</span>) expresses an inclination, the other
(<span lang="el">θέλω</span>) a positive purpose. The latter is the
word used here. It might justly be rendered <dfn>It
is my will</dfn>. It is nowhere else used by Jesus.
With the close of his prayer there comes such
assurance of his own unity with the Father that
he no longer prefers a request; he declares his
purpose. In this declaration of his purpose he
recurs to the promise which he had made at the
opening of this most sacred interview, “I will

<a href="#ch14_3">14:3</a></span>). In
this expression <cite>I will</cite>, Christ’s prayer can hardly
be a model for his followers. We may say to
our Father, I wish; but we can never be so sure
of his gracious purposes and of our union with
him in them, that we can safely say to him, <cite>Father,
I will</cite>.—&#8203;<b>That they may behold my glory,
which thou gavest me, because thou
lovedst me before founding a world.</b> Observe,
not <em>before the foundation of the world</em>, but
<em>before founding any world</em>; the definite article is
not in the original. On the significance of this
declaration as a testimony to the pre-existent
glory of Christ, see on <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_5">5</a>. To <dfn>behold</dfn> (<span lang="el">θεωρέω</span>)
is primarily to be a spectator of, and in its
primary signification includes the idea of attention,
wonder, admiration. It is, however, here
used certainly of spiritual apprehension; we
shall be filled with wonder and surprise when
the veil drops from our eyes and we see him as
he is. The glory which Christ had with the
Father from the beginning is the glory of the
Lamb slain from the foundation of the world
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 13:8</span>), the glory of a character whose radiance
is infinite love, of which the sacrifice of
Christ, purposed from the remote past, is the
highest manifestation; and this is the glory
which the saints, redeemed by his blood, behold
in heaven (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 5:8; 7:9; 21:23</span>). Christ’s will,
then, for his disciples is that they may be so
spiritually exalted that they may be able to apprehend
the full glory of that self-sacrificing
love which now they look upon with so feeble
appreciation, and which to the unbelieving world
is inglorious (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 1:23</span>). This is the consummation
of his prayer; what a climax in what an
ascending scale! First that his disciples may be
guarded in his absence by the divine care in
which he himself has trusted (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch17_11">11-13</a></span>); then that,
guarded in the world, they may be consecrated
to their Christly mission, to teach, to manifest
God, to suffer (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch15_15">15-19</a></span>); then that, with all believers,
they may be brought into spiritual unity with
the Father and his Son Jesus Christ, being made
sons of God, and so sharers in the glory of him
whose greatest glory it was and is to be the well-beloved
Son of the Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><a href="#ch20_23">20-23</a></span>); and finally
that, thus preserved, consecrated, adopted, they
may be able to realize the glory of that love of
self-sacrifice, to which we all sometimes find it
difficult even to submit without rebellion, and
in which only the most consecrated are ever
able to rejoice.</p>

<p><b>25, 26. O righteous Father.</b> Christ first
appealed simply to the Fatherhood of God
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch17_1">1</a></span>),
then to his holiness
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch17_11">11</a></span>), now at last even to
his righteousness or justice. For since the Son
has finished the work which the Father gave
him to do, he may ask of righteousness itself to
complete it. Thus justice and purity compete
with love in pleading for the fulfillment of redemption.
So in 1 John 1:9 it is said that “he
is faithful and <em>just</em> to forgive us our sins.”—<b>Though</b>
(<span lang="el">καὶ</span>) <b>the world has not known
thee, I have known thee, and</b> (<span lang="el">καὶ</span>) <b>these
have known that thou hast sent me forth</b>.
The world, the Son, and the disciples stand here
in a triple contrast; to the world God is the
absolute unknown; to the Son he is known; to
the disciples God is manifested in the Son, who
comes forth from God and goes to God again.—&#8203;<b>And
I have made known thy name to
them, and will make it known.</b> And with
the name all that the name <span style="white-space:nowrap;">represents—the</span> justice,
the holiness, and pre-eminently the Fatherhood.
See on <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch17_6">6</a>.
These words attest the
consciousness in Christ that an answer has been
vouchsafed to his prayer. He began by asking
the Father to glorify the Son, that the Son
might glorify the Father. He closes by declaring,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
not only that he has thus far made known
the name of the Father (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_5">5</a></span>), but that in the
impending hour of passion and death he will
make the Father known, and so will glorify him.
It is true that the whole work of the church ever
since, and of Christ in his church, has been making
known the name of the Father; but it has
been by interpreting the meaning of the cross of
Christ, by preaching Christ and him crucified,
as the wisdom and power of God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 1:16; 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr>
1:23, 24; 2:2</span>). Thus this prayer ends, as it began,
with an implied reference to the impending Passion;
but it begins with petition; it ends with
assurance of victory.—&#8203;<b>In order that the love
wherewith thou hast loved me may be in
them, and I in them.</b> That is, both that
they may possess an experience of the Father’s
love for them, and may possess a love like the
Father’s, being made perfect in love, even as
their Father in heaven is perfect (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 5:48</span>); so
also that the Spirit of Christ may dwell in them,
and that by this indwelling their own spirit may
be conformed unto his (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 3:18</span>). In this simple
and sublime sentence the Son embodies the object
of his mission as the Divine Teacher, the
Divine Revealer, and the Divine Sufferer. The
object of his teaching, incarnation, and atonement
is that he may make known the Father to
those that will learn of his Son; and this that he
may make them one with the Father and his
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">Son—one</span> in spiritual fellowship, because one in
spiritual character.</p>

<p>It is a shallow criticism which imagines an incongruity
between this prayer recorded by John
and the prayer in Gethsemane which immediately
followed, and which John has not recorded.
Here Christ asks that he may be enabled to glorify
the Father’s name to the end; there he asks
that the same results may, <em>if it is possible</em>, be
accomplished without the terrible ordeal of the
betrayal, the desertion, the mock trials, the
mob, the crucifixion, the veiling of the Father’s
face. But in the agony of Gethsemane, as portrayed
by the other three Evangelists, the Son
never for a moment wavers from the supreme
wish that the Father’s will may be accomplished
and the Father’s name made manifest. The
power, not merely to resign himself to the Father’s
will, but affirmatively to pray, “Not my
will but thine be done,” was a part of that very
glory with which he besought the Father to invest
him. The devout student will recognize in
the prayer of Gethsemane a partial answer to the
prayer in the upper chamber; for in Gethsemane,
no less than in the court of Caiaphas, the judgment
hall of Pilate, and the death on Calvary,
the Father glorified the Son and the Son glorified
the Father.</p>

<p><b><abbr title="Chapter">Ch.</abbr> 18:1-11.</b> <span class="smcap">The Betrayal and Arrest
of Jesus.—&#8203;The Divine Majesty of Our Lord
Exemplified.</span>—&#8203;Narrated by all the Evangelists:
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:47-56; Mark 14:43-52; Luke 22:47-53.
As usual where the four Evangelists narrate the
same events, John gives particulars omitted by
the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">others—the</span> falling back to the ground of the
guard, and Christ’s interposition for the disciples
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch18_6">6-9</a></span>)—&#8203;and omits events recorded by the
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">others—the</span> conference between Jesus and Judas,
and the traitor’s kiss (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:49, 50; Mark 14:44,
45</span>). That John wrote with the other accounts
before him, and to supply their omissions, is the
most reasonable explanation of these and like
variations in their accounts. He does not describe
the agony in Gethsemane, because he can
add nothing to what is already told; he narrates
of the arrest only what is not already known.
Even in describing the attempted resistance to
the arrest, this peculiarity is to be seen; for he
alone of the Evangelists mentions the name of
the disciple who drew the sword and of the servant
who was wounded by it. The discrepancies
in the four accounts of the arrest are such as we
should expect in four individual accounts of a
scene of such confusion. The probable order of
events, as indicated by a comparison of the accounts,
I have given in the notes on Matthew,
which consult throughout. Here I treat only
what is peculiar to John’s account.</p>

which the Greek is derived. The word rendered

flowed through a ravine to the east of Jerusalem,
and between it and the Mount of Olives.—&#8203;<b>Where

This was called Gethsemane, and was a customary

<p><b>2, 3. Judas then, having received the

soldiers; the officers were temple police;
the former were armed with swords, the latter
with staves. Servants of the priests, and some
of the priests themselves, accompanied the force.
See <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:47, note; Luke 22:52.—&#8203;<b>With
lanterns and torches.</b> “The fact of its being
full moon did not make the lights unnecessary,
as in searching for a prisoner they might have to
enter dark places.”—(<cite>Alford.</cite>) They appear also
to have had a fear of attempted flight or rescue.
See <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:48, note. I doubt whether any
definite distinction is intended between lanterns
and torches. The annexed cuts give illustrations
of two kinds of night torches used among
the Romans. The one (<em>fax</em>), (<abbr title="Richardson"><cite>Rich.</cite></abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 280) was
made out of a piece of resinous wood, cut into a
point and dipped in oil or pitch, or of inflammable
materials enclosed in a tube. The other
(<dfn>lampas</dfn>), (<abbr title="Richardson"><cite>Rich.</cite></abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 365) was in the nature of a
candlestick, with a handle beneath and a large
disk above, to protect the hand from the drippings
of the pitchy or resinous matter of which
the torch consisted. This <em>lampa</em> was carried by
the youth of Athens in a peculiar race, in which
the winner had to outstrip his competitors without
extinguishing his light. The ancient Oriental
lantern, like those still employed in Egypt
(see Lane’s <cite>Modern Egypt</cite>), consisted of a wax
cloth, strained over a sort of cylinder of iron
rings and a top and bottom of perforated copper.
Both the Roman torch and the Oriental lantern
may have been used on this occasion.</p>

<p><b>4, 5. Jesus, therefore, knowing all

merely knowing that the guard had come to
arrest him (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:45</span>), but with the full consciousness
of all the agony of the morrow (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
20:17-19; Luke 18:31-34</span>). Of his own will he submits
to the Passion (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:53; John 10:18</span>).—&#8203;<b>Went
forth.</b> Possibly from the shadow of the trees
into the moonlight, or from the garden walls, or
perhaps simply advanced to meet the guards.
His object in so doing is indicated by <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch18_8">8</a>.
He put himself between the guards and his disciples
to prevent the arrest of the latter. Judas
preceded the band (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 22:47</span>), and Christ’s questions
addressed to the apostate, and the traitor’s
kiss (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:49, 50; Luke 22:48</span>), seem to have taken
place before Christ spoke to the guard.—&#8203;<b>Jesus
the Nazarene.</b> Jesus, or <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Joshua—the</span> names are
the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">same—was</span> a common one among the Jews,
and the term “Nazarene” was a customary appellation,
especially by his foes, to designate our
Lord. Its tone, to the Judeans, was one of contempt
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 2:23;
John <a href="#ch19_19">19:19</a></span>).—&#8203;<b>And there stood
Judas, he that betrayed him, with them.</b>
If we suppose that Jesus hurried forth from the
garden, before the three disciples were well
awake, to the spot where the others had been
sleeping, then, not improbably, John did not see
the traitor’s kiss, but, arriving after, saw Judas
standing with the guard, who had meanwhile
come to the spot; thus he narrates only what he
personally witnessed. His language, by its very
simplicity, suggests to the imagination the contrast
between Jesus and Judas, the betrayed and
the betrayer.</p>

<p><b>6. They</b> (the guard) <b>went backward and

fact will not be questioned by any who believe
in the historical trustworthiness of the Gospel
narratives. That it describes a miracle, that is,
a sign of the superhuman character of Christ, is
equally certain. Whether it is to be regarded
as an effect produced by the <em>will</em> of our Lord, or
by the mere <em>majesty</em> and <em>dignity</em> of his mien, and
his reply, is the only question which believers in
the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> have to consider. I think the latter.
The scene is interpreted, though not fully explained,
by similar instances of moral power
excited by noble over savage natures. History
records several analogous cases, as when before
Mark Antony, Marius, and Coligny, the murderers
recoiled panic-stricken. So Avidius Cassius,
“springing to the door of his tent in nightdress,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
quelled a mutinous army by his mere
presence.”—(<cite>Farrar.</cite>) Lange cites <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 28:4;
Luke 4:30; John <a href="#ch7_44">7:44-46</a>;
<a href="#ch8_59">8:59</a>; <a href="#ch10_39">10:39</a>; Acts
5:5, 10, as partially parallel. The historical
cases above referred to illustrate the <em>human</em>
power of a noble soul; this case differs from
them in that it shows the <em>divine</em> power of Him
who not only spake as never man spake, but who
carried in his person the evidence that he was in
very deed the image of God and the brightness
of his glory. This view is confirmed by the
reflection that he came forth to meet the guard
from an hour of sacred and solemn communion
with God, of ecstasy unfathomable by us. “I
regard it,” says Alford, “rather as a miracle
<em>consequent upon</em> that which Christ said and did,
and the state of mind in which his enemies were,
than as one in the strict sense <em>wrought</em> by him;
bearing, however, always in mind, that to Him
nothing was unexpected or a <em>mere result</em>, but
everything foreknown.” Thus interpreted it is
a striking testimony, one of many, to the personal
glory of Him who was ever full of “grace
and truth,” and gives a solemn significance to
such passages as <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 25:31; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 1:7; 6:15-17.

Only one other disciple was armed (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 22:38</span>).
The request of Christ, “<cite>Let these go their way</cite>,”
was interpreted by the disciples as a direction
for them to flee, which they did. That there
was anything cowardly or wrong in this flight is
by no means clear. To sanction it, both Christ’s

<p><b>10, 11.</b> Christ follows his rebuke of Peter by
healing Malchus (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 22:51</span>). John alone gives
the name of either assailant or assailed. See for
reason, note on <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:51. Compare Christ’s
language here with Matthew’s report.—&#8203;Observe
that the evils brought upon us by wicked men
are yet recognized here as given by God. The
sufferings inflicted by Judas, Caiaphas, and Pilate,
and rendered necessary by the sins of the
world, are yet to Christ’s faith the cup which
his Father hath given him.</p>

<p><b>12-27.</b> <span class="smcap">The Preliminary Examination Of
Jesus before Caiaphas, and the Denials By
Peter.</span>—&#8203;This examination, narrated by John, is
distinctive from the trial reported by the Synoptists
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:57-68; Mark 14:53-65; Luke 22:63-71</span>). For
a general consideration of the harmony of the
Gospel narratives, and of their lessons, see notes
on Matthew. If John is the other disciple referred
to in verses <a href="#ch18_15">15</a>, <a href="#ch18_16">16</a>, he is the only one of the
Evangelists who was an eye and ear witness of
these events, and his order is presumptively the
correct one. For reasons appearing partly in the
notes on Matthew, partly in the notes below, I
believe that Jesus was sent at once from Annas
to Caiaphas, though the two may have occupied
different apartments in the same palace; that
the preliminary examination was conducted by
Caiaphas; that while it proceeded Peter was in
the adjoining courtyard, and there denied his
Lord; that at its conclusion Jesus was conducted
to the Sanhedrim, where the formal trial reported
by the Synoptists took place; and that this
trial is not described by John, perhaps because
he was not present, and wrote only of the events
which he personally witnessed.</p>

<b>13, 14. Annas first.</b> Annas was appointed
High Priest of the Jews <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 7, but had been removed
by the Roman Procurator several years
previous, and Joseph Caiaphas, his son-in-law,
had been appointed in his stead. In Luke 3:2
both are designated as high-priests, and in Acts
4:6; 23:2, the title is given to Annas. The
probable explanation is that while Caiaphas
held the office, he was really controlled by his
father-in-law, who may have been regarded by
the Jews as their true high-priest, notwithstanding
his deposition by the Romans. He seems to
have been one of that class of politicians who are
willing that others should possess the honors
and offices, provided they may wield the powers
of the state.—&#8203;<b>Caiaphas.</b> See <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:57,
note.—&#8203;<b>That same year.</b> The high-priest was
originally appointed for life, but the office was
now filled by appointees of the Roman government.
There were no fewer than twenty-eight
high-priests from the reign of Herod to the destruction
of the temple by Titus. Of these, five
besides Caiaphas were sons of Annas. It is possible
that there is a delicate sarcasm in John’s
incidental allusion to the transitoriness of the
office. This, at least, seems to me better than
to render the original (<span lang="el">ενιατός</span>) <em>era</em> instead of
<em>year</em>, though that is a possible translation, or to
suppose, with <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Fisher, that John thus simply
emphasizes the supreme importance which
that year, of the trial and crucifixion of Jesus,
had in his mind.—&#8203;<b>Which gave counsel.</b> See
John <a href="#ch11_49">11:49-51</a>.</p>

<p><b>15. Another disciple.</b> Who this other
disciple was is not certainly known, though Alford
says “there is no reason to doubt the universal
persuasion that by this name John intends
<em>himself</em>, and refers to the mention in
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch13_23">13:23</a>
of a disciple whom Jesus loved.” The notion
that it was Judas Iscariot is refuted by the language
of this verse. Judas did not follow Jesus,
but accompanied the band; and that Peter should
have entered the palace under the protection of
Judas after the betrayal is incredible. Some
manuscripts have the reading <em>the</em> other disciple,
which would identify him with John (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch20_2">20:2</a>, <a href="#ch20_3">3</a>, <a href="#ch20_4">4</a></span>).
But it seems more probable that the article was
added by some copyist to give definiteness to the
expression, than that it was subsequently omitted.—&#8203;<b>Was
known unto the high-priest.</b>
How, we have no means of ascertaining. John
<a href="#ch19_27">19:27</a> is, however, thought to indicate that the
apostle John had a house in Jerusalem.—&#8203;<b>Into
the palace of the high-priest.</b> Since John
describes Caiaphas as high-priest, this verse
clearly indicates that Jesus was taken at once
from Annas to Caiaphas. See on <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>

not thou <em>also</em> one of his disciples? indicates that
John was known to her as a disciple, and that
Peter’s first denial was uttered on entering, and
for the purpose of gaining an entrance. Observe
that it is not being in bad company, but fellowship
in it, that is dangerous. Peter and John
were both in the same company, but one concealed
his discipleship, the other did not.</p>

<p><b>19-21. The high-priest then asked Jesus.</b>
It was customary among the Jews to subject an
accused person to an examination analogous to
that practised at a later day in the Inquisition.
Witnesses concealed behind a screen reduced his
replies to writing. To such an examination, preliminary
to his formal trial, Jesus Christ was
now subjected.—&#8203;<b>Of his disciples and of his
doctrine.</b> The object of the first question was
to get evidence against his adherents, the object
of the second to get evidence against Jesus himself.
To the first Jesus pays no attention; to
the second he interposes a calm and dignified
protest.—&#8203;<b>I spoke openly.</b> Rather freely,
boldly. The original (<span lang="el">παῤῥησία</span>) signifies literally
<cite>speaking out all</cite>, that is, free-spokenness. Observe
that boldness and frankness of utterance
are essential qualifications of the true preacher.—&#8203;<b>In
secret have I said nothing.</b> Some
truths he had reserved because they could not
be understood (<span class="muchsmaller">John
<a href="#ch16_12">16:12</a>, <a href="#ch16_25">25</a></span>),
and others which he
had taught were not understood (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 13:13; 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr>
2:7, 8</span>); but there were no mysteries in his religious
teaching which he had sought to conceal
and for which he was amenable.—&#8203;<b>Ask them
which heard me.</b> Not improbably some of the
very officers so strangely affected by his preaching
were present. If so, this appeal to their own
subordinates would have incensed the priests,

<p><b>28, 29. Unto the hall of judgment.</b> Literally
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">Prætorium—the</span> name given among the Romans
to the headquarters of the Roman military
governor, wherever he happened to be; here it is
the residence which Pilate occupied in Jerusalem.
Whether that was the palace of King Herod, as
Farrar and others have supposed, or the tower of
Antonia, is uncertain; more probably the latter,
which was at the time and long afterwards the
citadel of Jerusalem, the headquarters of the
army, and the residence of the Roman governors.
It was built upon the same broad platform of
solid rock upon which the temple stood, and so
adjoined the walls of the latter that the Gentile
camp seemed a part of the Jewish sanctuary.
Four towers at its four corners gave it the appearance
of a castle and the strength of a fortress.
One of these towers looked down into the
broad courts of the temple, and thus subjected
all the gatherings there to the oversight of the
hated heathen, while its gates, opening directly
into those courts, rendered it easy, at a moment’s
notice, to quell any disturbance which might
occur there.—&#8203;<b>And it was early.</b> The original
(<span lang="el">πρωΐᾳ</span>) properly signifies the period between
daybreak and sunrise (<span class="muchsmaller">John
<a href="#ch20_1">20:1</a></span>), but it is also
used in a more general sense to signify the early
part of the forenoon (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 21:18</span>), and that must
be its meaning here, for this trial before Pilate
occurred certainly after the cock-crowing, and
probably the formal trial of Jesus before the
Sanhedrim and the subsequent deliberations of
the Sanhedrim to secure the execution of the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
death-sentence intervened between the cock-crowing
and their conducting Jesus to Pilate.—&#8203;<b>Lest
they should be defiled.</b> According to
the Pharisaic ideas they could not enter a Gentile
house without defilement, and this precluded
their participation in the passover, which in such
case must be postponed by those who were defiled
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Numbers">Numb.</abbr> 9:6-11</span>). A curious illustration of the
fallibility of conscience is this superstition of the
Pharisees, who feared defilement from entering
the house of a heathen, but none from the endeavor
to secure by fraud and violence the condemnation
of their Lord.—&#8203;<b>That they might
eat the Passover.</b> Here not the paschal supper,
but the festival which followed it, and
which lasted for seven days. See Note on the
Lord’s Supper, <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:30. The paschal supper
itself I believe to have been observed the
night before. An incidental confirmation of this
opinion is afforded by Wieseler, quoted in Lange,
who asserts that chronological calculations show
that in the year 30, the 14th of Nisan, on the evening
of which the supper proper took place, actually
fell on a Thursday; and it is certain that the
crucifixion of Christ occurred on Friday. If
Wieseler is correct, the Lord’s Supper must
have been the true paschal supper.—&#8203;<b>Pilate
went out unto them.</b> Pontius Pilate was the
Roman procurator or resident governor of Judea
at this time. On his authority, see <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 27:2,
note; on his character, career, and course here,
see note below, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch19_16">19:16</a>. His going out to
them was itself a concession.—&#8203;<b>Against this

have been the custom of the Romans to take
into their own hands in conquered provinces the
power of life and death, as one of the principal
attributes of sovereignty. There is no good reason
to doubt that this had been done in Palestine,
and that the Sanhedrim had no longer
power to execute the death-sentence. The execution
of Stephen, though in a certain sense
sanctioned by the Sanhedrim, was the act of a
mob (<span class="muchsmaller">Acts 7:57, 58</span>).
Pilate’s answer to the demand
of the priests is ironical, a bitter reminder to
them that they had no longer the power of sovereignty.
Other interpretations, such as that
they had no power to crucify, or none to execute
on the feast-day, or none to punish crimes against
the state, are both unnecessary and improbable.</p>

<p><b>33. Then Pilate entered into the judgment-hall

by the throng as King of the Jews; and his arrest

<p><b>34, 35. Jesus answered him</b>, etc.—&#8203;This
question is not asked for information as to the
nature of the charge preferred against him and
the character of his accusers, for evidently Jesus
was present when they preferred it; nor as a
means of ascertaining in what sense Pilate used
the title <em>king</em>, whether in the Jewish sense, to
signify the promised founder of the kingdom of
heaven, or in a Roman sense, to signify a political

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
kingdom antagonistic to Jewish authority. For
he who knew what was in man, understood Pilate’s
character and mind. It was the most
forcible possible reply to the accusation. Who,
he asks, has preferred this charge? The Jews.
Pilate’s mind instantly grasps the conclusion.
“If it had been preferred by a Roman centurion,
it would have been worthy of examination.
But when was it ever known that the Jewish
priesthood complained of one who sought the
political emancipation of the nation? None
knew better than Pilate how uneasy were the
people under the Roman yoke. The voices of
the mob before the judgment-seat crying out for
Jesus’ blood were unwitting witnesses of his
innocence.”—(<cite>Lyman Abbott’s Jesus of Nazareth.</cite>)—&#8203;The reply had the desired effect. Pilate’s response,
“Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and
the chief priests have delivered thee unto me,”
shows how quickly he filled out the argument
which Christ by a question suggested to his mind.—&#8203;<b>What
hast thou done?</b> An honest question.
He rejects the testimony of the priesthood
to the sedition of the prisoner (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 23:2</span>), and appeals

<p><b>36. Jesus answered.</b> Honest perplexity
he would not refuse to answer. Contrast his
silence before Caiaphas (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:62</span>), Herod (Luke
23:9), and later before Pilate himself
(<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch19_9">19:9</a></span>).—&#8203;<b>My
kingdom is not of this world.</b> Its origin
is not from the earth. The preposition <em>of</em>
(<span lang="el">ἐκ</span>) signifies the source or origin from which
anything springs. Christ’s kingdom is <em>in</em> the
world and <em>over</em> the world, but not <em>from</em> the
world nor maintained by worldly means.—&#8203;<b>If my
kingdom were of this world, then would
my servants fight.</b> Not angels, of which Pilate
knew nothing; nor the twelve, of whom it
is doubtful whether he knew anything. The
argument was one which readily addressed itself
to Pilate’s understanding. If Jesus were an
earthly king, his followers would have defended
him from arrest by his enemies and theirs. It is
true Peter had done so (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch18_10">10</a></span>), but he had been
rebuked, and the wound he inflicted had been
miraculously healed, so that the priesthood
could not appeal to this resistance in support of
their charge, except by misrepresenting it.—&#8203;<b>That
I should not be delivered to the
Jews.</b> <em>Jews</em> generally in John means the Judeans,
the inhabitants of the southern province of
Palestine, who were Christ’s especial opponents.—&#8203;<b>But
now is my kingdom not from hence.</b>
<em>Now</em> is not here a particle of time, but of connection.
That is, the meaning is not, My kingdom
is not <em>now</em> of this world, as though its temporal
power and glory was to come by and by,
but, <em>Thus</em> you see my kingdom is not, etc. The
former meaning has been given to the word by
some Roman Catholic commentators, to break
the force of the declaration as a testimony against
the temporal power of the Pope and the priesthood.
For similar connective use of the particle
(<span lang="el">νῦν</span>) <em>now</em>, see Acts 12:11; 22:16; 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 14:6.
Observe in this verse: (1) A distinct declaration
of the supernatural origin and character of
Christ’s kingdom. Christianity is not a development
of <em>human thought</em>, but a gift to man <em>from
God</em>. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>
John <a href="#ch3_3">3:3</a>; <a href="#ch8_23">8:23</a>;
<a href="#ch13_3">13:3</a>; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 21:2.
(2) It is to be defended by spiritual, not by earthly
or physical means. With the spirit of this
declaration all attempts to maintain the church
or its truth by civil enactment or the power of
the sword are inconsistent. How little the spiritual
nature of Christ’s kingdom was understood
in the middle ages is indicated by the fact that
even Calvin, on this passage, argues that kings
and princes may “employ all the power they
possess in defending the church and maintaining
godliness.” (3) The strength and permanence of
Christ’s kingdom as compared with kingdoms
built up on or defended by might of arms.
“Here he sheweth the weakness of kingship
among us, that its strength lies in servants; but
that which is above is sufficient for itself, needing
nothing.”—(<cite>Chrysostom.</cite>)</p>

Either rendering is admissible (see <cite>Winer</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 512).—&#8203;<b>Jesus
said unto him, Thou sayest</b> (truly);
<b>for I am a king</b>. This is truer to the original
than our English version. The first clause of
the sentence, “<cite>Thou sayest</cite>,” is a common form
of Jewish affirmation, and was not confined to
the Jews (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 26:64, note</span>). The second clause
gives emphasis to this affirmation, and the reason
for it, <em>for I am a king</em>. Observe how the
solemn testimony of Christ to his divine Messiahship
before Caiaphas is here, in a different form,
reiterated before Pilate.—&#8203;<b>To this end was I
born, and for this cause came I into the
world.</b> The first clause does not necessarily
imply a pre-existence, because, in a sense, every
creature is born to fulfil a divine purpose; but

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
the second clause would be tautological, a mere
repetition of the first, if it did not indicate a
coming into the world from a pre-existent state
and for a particular purpose. And Pilate seems
to have partially, at least, so understood it
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch19_9">19:9</a>, note</span>).—&#8203;<b>Every one that is of the truth</b>

is, who has so far come under the influence of
truth, is so far born anew by the power of the
truth on his own soul, as to be a sincere seeker
after truth, and hence, in a deeper sense, so far
under the influence of the Spirit of God, who is
the Truth, as to be seeking to know Him who is
the Truth incarnate in human life. Parallel to
this declaration are John <a href="#ch6_45">6:45</a>;
<a href="#ch8_47">8:47</a>. Observe,
(1) Jesus Christ is not only a teacher, an example,

him as a Saviour only as we accept him as
our King (<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch15_10">15:10</a>;
1 John 3:22-24</span>); (2) the object
of his incarnation is to testify to the truth, which
he does by his words, and yet more by incarnating
the truth in living forms, perfectly in his
own life, imperfectly in the lives of his followers;
(3) they only hear (<em>receive</em>) him, in whom
the spirit of truth-seeking already exists. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>

<p><b>8, 9. He was the more afraid, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou?</b>
But Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate’s was not
a superstitious fear, but a genuine awe produced
by the personal presence of Jesus, the power of
which was conspicuously manifested on other
occasions in his life (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 4:30; 5:8;
<a href="#ch7_45">John 7:45</a>, <a href="#ch7_46">46</a>;
<a href="#ch18_6">18:6</a></span>). It was doubtless
enhanced by the report
of his wife’s dream (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 27:19</span>).
His question,
<cite>Whence art thou?</cite> is to be interpreted by this
awe; not <em>from what province</em>, for he knew this
(<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 23:6, 7</span>), nor <em>of what parents</em>, for this was a
matter of indifference. The question indicates
that even skeptical Pilate vaguely felt that the
prisoner before <span style="white-space:nowrap;">him—the</span> King of a kingdom of
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">truth—was</span> no ordinary man. Christ’s silence
was a bitter rebuke. Pilate was no longer an
honest seeker after truth. Christ “kept silent,
in fine, because he knew as well when to hold
his peace as when to speak, and no word that he
ever uttered was fuller of inspiration than that
silence; no, not even does that lofty declaration
to Pilate, ‘Yes, I am a King, and every true man
is my subject,’ show a more regal dignity of
mind. From every feature, from his whole person,
it <span style="white-space:nowrap;">spoke—spoke</span> of a world of power in him,
power to rise above all personal considerations,
and, under the most terrible circumstances, to
find entire serenity in the perfect possession of
himself.”—(<cite>Furness.</cite>)</p>

<p><b>11.</b> The connection of Christ’s answer here is
difficult. It appears to me to be as follows:
All civil and political power comes from God
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Romans">Rom.</abbr> 13:1; <abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> <abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 75:6, 7; <abbr title="Daniel">Dan.</abbr> 2:21</span>). Even on earth
kings are recognized as the administrators of the
divine will (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Isaiah">Isa.</abbr> 44:28; 45:1</span>). Caiaphas and the
priesthood, therefore, in delivering Jesus to Pilate,
are endeavoring not only to accomplish a
deed of injustice, but to induce a divinely appointed
minister of God to prove false to the
trust reposed in him. Therefore their sin is
greater than his; they are the instigators, he the
partially ignorant and unwilling instrument.
<abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> Luke 12:47, 48. Stier observes that Pilate’s
ignorance includes him in the Lord’s
prayer, “Father, forgive them, for they know
not what they do” (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 23:34</span>). That most wonderful
declaration of the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>, “He knoweth
our frame, he remembereth that we are dust”
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 103:14</span>), receives its most wonderful illustration

<p><b>14. It was the preparation of the passover.</b>
That is, the preparation for the Passover
Sabbath. The strictness of the Mosaic law respecting
the Sabbath necessitated special preparations
for it on the previous day, and in process
of time the whole day prior came to be known
as <em>the preparation</em> (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 15:42</span>). If we so understand
the passage, there is nothing in it inconsistent
with the fact indicated by the other
Evangelists that the paschal supper was taken
by Christ and his disciples, in common with the
rest of the nation, on the evening preceding.—&#8203;<b>About
the sixth hour.</b> But according to
Mark it was the <em>third hour</em> (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 15:25</span>); and this
is sustained by the whole course of the transactions
and the circumstances, as also by the statements
of Matthew (<span class="muchsmaller">27:45</span>), Luke (<span class="muchsmaller">23:44</span>), and Mark
(<span class="muchsmaller">15:33</span>), that the darkness commenced at the sixth
hour, after Jesus had for some time hung upon
the cross. Of this discrepancy many explanations
have been proposed, but only two are worthy
of any consideration. One that by an early
error in transcription the sixth was substituted
for the third hour here; the other that John
here only indicates that the sixth hour was approaching,
or, as Lange renders it, <cite>it was going
on towards the sixth hour</cite>; that is, the third hour,
which closed the preceding watch into which the
day was divided, had already passed, and that
Mark’s language simply implies that the third
hour had already passed before the crucifixion.
It is certain that the ancients did not fix the time
with as great precision as we do, and that in particular,
as Godet says, “the apostles did not count
with the watch in their hands.”—<b>Behold your
King.</b> The previous appeal
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>

This was true. By this very act they disavowed
allegiance to Jehovah as their King (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Samuel">Sam.</abbr> 12:12</span>).
They were thus emphatically guilty themselves
of the crime of blasphemy, for which they had
condemned Jesus. Some of these very men subsequently
perished in rebellion against Cæsar,
thus by their death testifying to the hypocrisy
of their pretended zeal. He who refuses Christ
as his King subjects himself to the despotism of
worldly authority.—&#8203;<b>Then delivered he to

of soldiers to execute the decree. Thus Roman
and Jew shared in both decreeing and executing
the sentence.</p>

<p><a id="Note_ch19"></a>
<span class="smcap">On the Character of Pontius <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Pilate.</span>—Concerning</span>
Pilate’s life before he became procurator
nothing is known, except that his name
indicates a probability that he was a freedman,
or the descendant of a freedman, connected with
the Pontian house. He succeeded Valerius Gratus
as procurator of Judea and Samaria, about the
year 26 <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>,
and he held the appointment for a
period of ten years. Secular history shows him
to have been unscrupulous in the exercise of his
authority; and instances are recorded by Josephus
of his contempt of the Jews. His behavior
was equally tyrannical toward the Samaritans;
and on their complaint to Vitellius, president or
prefect of Syria, Pilate was ordered to go to
Rome to answer for his conduct before the emperor.
His deposition must have occurred in
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 36,
most probably prior to the Passover.
Before he arrived in Rome, however, Tiberius
was dead. According to tradition, Pilate was
banished by Caligula to Vienne, in Gaul; according
to Eusebius, he died by his own hand.</p>

<p>Though in the oldest Christian creed his name
is indissolubly linked with the crucifixion, in the
phrase “suffered under Pontius Pilate,” and
though he was directly responsible for it, since
it could not have been consummated without his
judicial approbation, yet that approbation was
wrested from him by a mob, and he yielded only
when further resistance would have hazarded

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
his office, if not his life. The story of the trial
of Christ before Pilate is the story of a conflict
between a judge who appealed in vain to the
moral sense of the priesthood, and a priesthood
who appealed not in vain to the fears of the
judge. First he scornfully bids the Jews try
Jesus according to their own law, knowing that
they cannot put their prisoner to death
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch18_31">18:31</a></span>);
then catches, in the clamor, the word “Galilee,”
and endeavors to rid himself of responsibility by
sending the prisoner to Herod (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 23:4-12</span>); on
the return of the prisoner to his custody, proposes
to release him, as a customary act of good-will,
to the populace (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
27:19-23; Mark 15:8-14</span>);
orders the scourging, in an idle hope so to satisfy
the clamor of the mob (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
27:26-30; Mark 15:15-19;
John <a href="#ch19_1">19:1-3</a></span>); having appealed in vain to their pity,
appeals, also in vain, to their patriotism (<span class="muchsmaller">John
<a href="#ch19_4">19:4-15</a></span>); and finally pronounces sentence of death
only under an implied threat of complaint to the
jealous Tiberius Cæsar (<span class="muchsmaller">John
<a href="#ch19_12">19:12</a>, <a href="#ch19_16">16</a></span>). But it
would be a mistake to suppose that in this pitiable
conflict with a mob, which it was Pilate’s
first duty to quell, he was influenced by considerations
of either humanity or justice. The contempt
which a Roman soldier would naturally
feel for the Jewish priesthood was intensified
into a bitter personal hate by the fact that their
cunning had twice overmatched his <span style="white-space:nowrap;">strength—once</span>
when, immediately after his inauguration,
they had compelled him to remove the hated
Roman standards from the city of Jerusalem to
the old-time Roman military headquarters at
Cæsarea Philippi; once when they had secured
orders from Tiberius Cæsar directing him to
take down the Roman shields from the vicinity
of the temple. The one sentiment which was
strong in a Roman soldier was that of justice; to
be compelled by a Jewish mob, instigated by the
Jewish priesthood, to assume the judicial robes
only to do flagrant injustice in them, and that in
executing the Jewish will, angered him. He
was a tool in the hands of an unscrupulous and
despised hierarchy; knew it, and fought against
the humiliation weakly, and therefore in vain.
He was also powerfully affected by the personal
bearing of Christ. “If there is any power in the
human countenance, in the eye, in the voice, in
the whole air and manner of a man, that power
must have been manifested in Jesus in the very
highest degree. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Not that he (Pilate)
had the slightest insight into the lofty nature of
that power. His very ignorance of it served, by
creating a feeling of mystery, only to heighten
the effect of it upon his mind.”—(<cite>Furness.</cite>) And
this effect was still further increased by the
dream of his wife; for skepticism and superstition
are twins, and the skeptical Pilate was not
above the universal superstitions of his times.
All these elements made Pilate angry with himself
and with the hierarchy, but they did not
serve in lieu of a noble resolution, which alone
could have enabled him to resist the threatening
danger of an emeute. So he dallied, argued,
appealed, yielded. The crime of Pontius Pilate
was the crime of moral cowardice. It was more
appalling in its results, but it was not different
in its nature, from the many manifestations of
that crime which we all often witness, and which
most of us sometimes have experienced.</p>

substantially, in none of them verbally, the same.
Thus:</p>


<ul><li>This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.—&#8203;(<cite>Matthew.</cite>)</li>
<li>The King of the Jews.—&#8203;(<cite>Mark.</cite>)</li>
<li>This is the King of the Jews.—&#8203;(<cite>Luke.</cite>)</li>
<li>Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.—&#8203;(<cite>John.</cite>)</li>
</ul>

<p class="unindent">Apparently there were three inscriptions, in the
three different languages; some commentators
suppose that they differed slightly, and that the
variations in the language of the inscription indicate
the variations in the original. See this ingeniously
argued in Townsend’s <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> But the
better opinion is that the inscription was the
same in the three languages, and that the verbal
differences are such as we might expect from
individual narrators, who, in minor details, were
left to their own recollection. So Robinson, Alford,
Greenleaf, etc. Analogous verbal differences
are to be constantly met with in the Evangelists:
<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 3:11; Mark 1:7; Luke 3:16;
John <a href="#ch1_27">1:27</a>—<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 9:11; Mark 2:16; Luke 5:30—<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
15:27; Mark 7:28—<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 16:6-9;
Mark 8:17-19—<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 20:33; Mark 10:51;

28:5, 6; Mark 16:6; Luke 24:5, 6.
Pilate illustrates the difference between firmness
and obstinacy. In yielding the crucifixion of an
innocent man, Pilate showed a pitiable lack of
firmness; in insisting on retaining an insulting
inscription, he showed a petty obstinacy. In
this inscription he was an unconscious prophet
of the truth to all <span style="white-space:nowrap;">on-lookers—Greek,</span> Roman,

<p><b>23, 24.</b> The account of John of this incident
is fuller and more exact than those of the other
Evangelists. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr> <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 27:35; Mark 15:24;
Luke 23:34. There were four <span style="white-space:nowrap;">soldiers—a</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">quaternion—detailed</span>
to watch the execution of the
sentence of the procurator. The clothing of the
convicted was the perquisite of the soldiers.
The outer garments of Christ were divided
among them, one to each. The inner garment,
or tunic, was a seamless robe, woven in one
piece, probably of wool. There is no ground for
the fanciful comparison of this robe with those
worn by the priests, as though it indicated a
priestly function on Christ’s part. There is
more reason in the surmise that it was a gift to
him by some of the women who had followed
him from Galilee (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 8:1-3</span>).—&#8203;But
this is a mere
surmise, having no other support than the fact
that the soldiers seem to have recognized in it a
peculiar value, a garment which it were a pity
to destroy. Dice were in Rome what cards are
in modern life. One of the soldiers took a set
out of his pocket; the helmet would have served
as a dice-box; and thus, under the shadow of
the cross, they gambled for this seamless robe.
The incident affords a most striking illustration
of the inhumanity of man, and scarcely less
of the indurating influence of the passion for
gambling. “No earthly creatures but gamblers
could be so lost to all feeling as to sit
down coolly under a dying man to wrangle for
his garments, and arbitrate their avaricious differences
by casting dice for his tunic, with hands
spotted with his spattered blood, warm and yet
undried upon them.”—(<cite>H. W. Beecher.</cite>) The
twenty-second Psalm, to the prophecy of which
John refers, was regarded by the Jews, as it has
been universally regarded by all Christian critics,
as a Messianic Psalm. A curious illustration of
fanciful interpretation is afforded by Wordsworth’s
treatment of this scene, though he
quotes Augustine as his authority: The parted
garments is an emblem of the church in its universality,
to be sent out into the four quarters
of the globe; the unparted garment is emblematic
of the church in its unity, to be kept whole
and unparted; the gambling soldiers are an emblem
of those who treat the unity of the church
of Christ as a matter of indifference.</p>

<p><b>25-27. Now there stood by the cross of
Jesus his mother</b>, etc. There is some question
whether we are to understand by this verse

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
that there were <em>four</em> women there, or only three.
Some scholars read the phrases “his mother’s
sister” and “Mary of Cleophas” as in apposition,
and suppose them to refer to the same person;
but the better opinion regards them as different
persons, the mother’s sister being identified
with Salome, the mother of James and John,
who, if this interpretation be correct, were own
cousins to Jesus. See Note on the Twelve
Apostles, Matthew, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 10, <abbr title="Volume One">Vol. I</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 148, where
this question is more fully discussed. It is important
only in its bearing on the question of the
relationship of Jesus to James and John.—&#8203;<b>Woman,
behold thy son; *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* behold
thy mother.</b> Some doubt has been thrown on
this incident by rationalistic critics, who have
thought it improbable that these women could
have been standing near enough to the cross to
hear the words of Jesus; or that they could
have been willing to do so; or that the incident,
if it really occurred, could have escaped the
other Evangelists; for it is peculiar to John.
The answer to this criticism is admirably given by
Dr. Furness: “Unquestionably it must have been
agonizing to her to witness that awful sight. And
it would have been no less agonizing to her to
keep at a distance from him. May she not have
thought within herself, ‘It kills me to see him
suffer so, but I cannot lose a word that may fall
from his lips; perhaps he may speak to me’? The
women friends of Jesus stood looking on at a
distance; but if there were one among them who
stood nearer to the cross than the others, it must
have been his mother. Here again the words of
Jesus to his mother and the beloved disciple
lose the living truth of nature in our Common
Version, which gives them in the form of complete
sentences, ‘<cite>Woman, behold thy son</cite>,’ and to
John, ‘<cite>Behold thy mother</cite>.’ But in the original it
is ‘<cite>Woman! look! thy son!</cite>’ and to John, ‘<cite>Look!
thy mother!</cite>’ brief as possible, ejaculatory, broken,
and in the fullest accord with the physical
condition in which he then was—a state of extreme
torture, admitting only at the moment of
such imperfect utterance. His mother was not
very near the cross, but near enough to allow
Jesus, by a strong effort mastering his agony, to
gasp out these few words, leaving it to the keen
sense of his mother and John to make out his
meaning. Indeed, if I could suspect such an incident
as this to be an invention, I should not know
what limit to assign to the inventive power of the
authors of the Gospels.”—(<cite>Notes on Schenckel’s
Character of Jesus.</cite>)—<b>And from that hour
that disciple took her to his own.</b> The
words <cite>from that hour</cite> are not to be taken literally,
as though John and the mother of Jesus did
not remain till death had brought the lingering
tortures of the crucifixion to an end. The words
<em>his own</em> are more significant without the addition
of the word <em>home</em>, added by the translators.
John took the mother into his own circle, and as
his own mother, from that time. The language
does not imply that he had a fixed domicile in
Jerusalem. This is not inherently probable, for
he was a Galilean; and certainly nothing recorded
had occurred to make any of the disciples
prior to this time inclined to take up a permanent
residence in Jerusalem.</p>

<p><b>28-30.</b> See <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 27:47-49, notes. The incident
is common to all the Evangelists, but their
accounts are quite different. John alone repeats
the utterance, “It is finished,” which is to be
regarded not merely as a presage of death, equivalent
to, The era of suffering is ended, the era of
joy begins; but as triumphant and prophetic:
The work which thou gavest me to do is finished
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_4">17:4</a></span>); and this because Christ died once for
all, thus perfecting a sacrificing which needs
never to be repeated (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Hebrews">Heb.</abbr> 9:28</span>), and because by
it he offers to the believer a redemption which
is finished, and which needs not to be supplemented
to make it efficacious. The cry of almost
despair, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
me?” was followed by the cry of triumph,
uttered with a loud voice (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 27:50; Mark 15:37;
Luke 23:46</span>); and then, with the prayer, “Father,
into thy hands I commit my spirit” (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 23:46</span>),
he bowed his head and gave up the ghost. Some
scholars (<cite>Chrysostom</cite>, <cite>Hengstenberg</cite>, <cite>Godet</cite>, etc.)
hold that the reference to prophecy here is
to Psalm 69:21, and that the meaning is that
Christ said “I thirst” in order to fulfill prophecy;
others (<cite>Meyer</cite>, <cite>Luthardt</cite>) make the phrase
“that the Scripture might be fulfilled” dependent
on the preceding clause, and the meaning to
be that all things were accomplished that the
Scripture might be fulfilled. This seems to me
to be the better interpretation. The other
makes Christ utter the expression of thirst for
the purpose of calling forth in others the fulfillment
of a prophecy. It may be remarked here
that the constant use of the phrase <cite>that the Scripture
might be fulfilled</cite> gives to a casual reader the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
impression that a multitude of minor incidents
were ordered by God, and unimportant acts
were performed by Christ, merely to fulfill <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>
prophecy. The reader must, however, remember
that the Gospels were written primarily for
Jewish readers in large measure, and that the
test by which every Jew determined whether or
no Jesus was the Messiah was by asking the
question, Does he fulfill the ancient prophecies?
While, therefore, it is true that Christ’s life does
fulfill, even in marvellously minute details, the
prophecies of the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>, it is also true that these
fulfillments are pointed out by the Evangelists
with an emphasis which in our time seems excessive,
but which was not so in their age and
for their immediate purpose. Compare the apostolic
speeches to Jewish audiences, as reported
in Acts, which are almost wholly devoted to
proving that Christ’s life and death were in accordance
with ancient Jewish prophecies.</p>

<p><b>31-37. Because it was the preparation.</b>
That is, for the Sabbath. At first the hours,
then the entire day, immediately preceding the
Sabbath, was called by the Jews the Preparation.
See on <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch19_14">14</a>, and more fully on Mark 15:42.
The Jews, who had no hesitation about compassing
by the most unscrupulous methods the
death of an innocent man, were scrupulous about
leaving his corpse to hang on the cross over the
Sabbath—a notable illustration of Sabbatical
ceremonialism. It was the Roman custom to
leave the corpse to putrefy; this was forbidden
by the Jewish law, which, partly as a sanitary,
partly as a ceremonial regulation, required immediate
burial. See <abbr title="Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> 21:23.—&#8203;<b>That their
legs might be broken.</b> A barbarous but not
uncommon method of accelerating death, adopted
in order to enhance rather than mitigate the
horrors of the execution.—&#8203;<b>Then came the
soldiers and brake the legs</b>, etc. The implication
is, of course, that this was done under
the orders of Pilate. Nor is there anything inconsistent
in this account with that in Mark (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark
15:44</span>), that Pilate was surprised to learn that
Jesus was dead, and inquired into the certainty
of the fact before giving permission to Joseph
of Arimathea to remove the body. For when the
death of Jesus was reported to him, the circumstances
would also have been reported; and thus
Pilate would have known that the soldiers found
him already dead when they came to break the
legs of the three.—&#8203;<b>But one of the soldiers
with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith
came thereout blood and water.</b>
On the physical significance of this fact, see below,
Note on the Physical Cause of Christ’s
Death. From it the spiritualizing commentators
have drawn many mystical lessons, most of them
of very doubtful profit; <i>e. g.</i>, the comparison of
the drawing of Eve from the side of Adam and
the drawing of the church from the side of
Christ; the necessity of both blood and water
to regeneration (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch3_5">3:5</a></span>); the use of both as emblems
of the sacraments, etc. All such uses of
this incident belong at best to the poet, not the
commentator, and its use even by the poet must
be cautious, or it becomes unprofitable. The
object of the spear-thrust was not to determine
whether death had actually taken place so much
as to ensure death, if there were any doubt.
The record is given partly to set at rest the ancient
Gnostic skeptical whim that the death took
place only in seeming; it equally does set at rest
the suggestion of more modern skepticism that
Christ merely fainted from exhaustion and was
subsequently restored by the disciples.—&#8203;<b>And
he that saw it bare record, and his record
is true</b>, etc. The use of this phraseology shows
the importance which John gave to this particular
fact; partly, perhaps, because it established
the all-important fact of the actual death of the
Lord, the culmination of his life of self-sacrifice,
and equally the foundation of that proof of his
divinity which is afforded by his resurrection
from the dead. But I believe that it also gives
emphasis to the real cause of the death of our
Lord—a broken heart, broken for the sins of the
world, which he bore on the tree. It is also a
water-mark of authorship. “The testimony thus
declared to be veracious is just the record itself
which the narrator was setting down; and, as
he says it comes from no other than the eye-witness,
he certainly gives us to understand that he,
the Evangelist, is also the disciple whom Jesus
loved.”—(<cite>James Martineau.</cite>)—&#8203;The prophetic
Scriptures referred to are <abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> 12:46 and

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
<abbr title="Zechariah">Zech.</abbr> 12:10. The first passage, “A bone of
him shall not be broken,” refers primarily to the
paschal lamb; but that lamb was regarded by
the Jews, and is treated both by the Old Testament
and the New, as a type of the Lamb of
God that taketh away the sins of the world.

Meyer’s notes on this passage. I believe that
there is at least good reason for the opinion that
he died of a literally broken heart. Crucifixion
produced a very lingering death. No vital organ
was directly affected. The victim rarely died in
less than twenty-four hours. Instances are recorded
of his lingering a full week. It was customary
to dispatch the condemned after a few
hours of torture by speedier means. This was
done in the case of the thieves. Pilate was surprised
at the intelligence that Jesus was already
dead. The guard seems to have shared that
surprise. Up to the last moment there was no
sign of weakness, no decay of power or vitality.
Jesus conversed with the thief and spoke to his
friends. His last cry was not that of exhausted
nature; he cried with a <span style="white-space:nowrap;">loud—literally</span> great,
<i>i. e.</i>, <span style="white-space:nowrap;">strong—voice</span>. His death was instant.
There was something remarkable in <span style="white-space:nowrap;">it—something</span>
that attracted the attention of the centurion
and his band. It followed immediately
after the cry, “My God! my God! why hast
thou forsaken me?” This agony succeeded that
of Gethsemane. In that midnight struggle the
heart and blood-vessels were affected. The palpitation
of the heart was so intense as to cause
bloody sweat—a phenomenon rare, but not unknown,
and produced by intense mental excitement.
That this was a truly bloody sweat, see
Luke 22:44, note. The heart would probably
have been weakened by such an experience. A
repetition of the agony then endured might
truly rupture the membrane of the heart. Such
an experience has been known to produce such
a result. If it did, death would instantly ensue.
The blood would flow into the pericardium, an
outer sac in which the heart is enclosed; there
it would be liable to separate very rapidly into
clots of extravasated blood and water. When
the soldier thrust the spear into Jesus’ side, it
was probably with a double purpose: to ascertain
whether Jesus was dead; to ensure his
death if he were not. For this purpose he would
aim at the heart. The spear would pierce, of
course, the left, not the right side, as portrayed
in nearly all art representations of the crucifixion.
The water, followed and accompanied by
the clots of blood, would flow from the wound.
It is impossible to account for this phenomenon,
not only recorded by John, but evidently regarded
by him of considerable importance, except
upon the hypothesis of a broken heart, or
of some organic disease. Andrews’s hypothesis
that it was supernatural has nothing but a devout
surmise to sustain it. The reader who
desires to investigate this subject more thoroughly
will find by far the fullest and ablest discussion
of it in Stroud’s <cite>Physical Cause of the
Death of Christ</cite>, London, 1847, especially <abbr title="chapter four">ch. iv</abbr>,

<p><b>38-42. After this came Joseph of Arimathea.</b>
Of him nothing is known except
what may be gathered from the accounts of the
Evangelists concerning him in this connection.
Mark implies that he was a member of the Sanhedrim
(<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 15:43</span>), and Luke that he had nothing
to do with the condemnation of Jesus; probably
was not present (<span class="muchsmaller">see Luke 23:51, note</span>), either because
he knew what was coming before them and that
his resistance would be in vain, or because the
others knew his character, and did not summon
him. Luke also describes him as a “good man
and just.” His act in requesting the body of
Christ after the crucifixion was one requiring
some courage. In later martyrdoms such a request
cost men their lives; in this case it must
at least have cost Joseph much obloquy. The
site of Arimathea is entirely uncertain. The
effect of Christ’s death to make the cowardly
strong is noticed by all commentators.—&#8203;<b>Pilate
gave him leave.</b> After making sure that
Christ was really dead (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark
15:44, 45</span>).—&#8203;<b>Took the
body of Jesus.</b> This taking down from the
cross was probably done by the loving hands of
the disciples; this is more probable than that it
was done by the Roman soldiers. Their last

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
duty was performed when they made sure of the
death of the condemned.—&#8203;<b>There came also
Nicodemus.</b> It was now even, that is, the
early evening, probably between four o’clock
and sunset. See <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 27:57, note. On the
character of Nicodemus, see <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch3_1">3:1</a>, note.—&#8203;<b>Brought
a mixture of myrrh and aloes,
about a hundred pounds weight.</b> “Myrrh-resin
and aloe-wood; these fragrant materials
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> 45:8</span>) were placed, in a pulverized condition,
between the bandages. But the surprising quantity
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr>
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch12_3">12:3</a></span>) is here explained from the fact
that superabundant reverence in its sorrowful excitement
does not easily satisfy itself; we may also
assume that a portion of the spices was designed
for the couch of the body in the grave” (<cite>Meyer</cite>);
or to be burned. See below.—&#8203;<b>As the manner of
the Jews is to bury.</b> There is no evidence
that the Hebrews ever practised systematic embalming,
as the Egyptians did. In the <abbr title="Old Testament">O. T.</abbr>
there is but one mention of any such practice,
that of the case of Asa, and he was not properly
embalmed, but laid in the bed which he had prepared
for himself “with perfumes and spices”
(<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Chronicles">Chron.</abbr> 16:14</span>). It appears to have been the custom
in the time of Christ to wash the body and
anoint it, then to wrap it in fine linen, with
spices and ointments enveloped in the folds, and
afterwards to pour more ointment upon it, and
sometimes to burn spices. In the case of Christ,
the approach of the Sabbath hurried the preparations
of the body, which were not yet completed
at sunset, and were left to be finished the
day after the Sabbath.—&#8203;Comparing the four
accounts of the burial, it appears that the body
was wrapped in fine linen, with some of the
spices, and laid hurriedly away in a rock-hewn
sepulchre in a garden near the place of the crucifixion,
one in which no previous burial had
ever taken place. According to Matthew, it
belonged to Joseph (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 27:59, 60; Mark 15:46; Luke
23:53, 54</span>). For illustration of the body prepared
for burial, see Acts 5:6, note; for illustration
of Jewish tomb, see Mark 16:2-4, notes. For a
striking sermon on the Significance of the Sepulchre
in the Garden, sorrow amid flowers, see

<p>The accounts of the resurrection and the incidents

and the ascension given by the four

seemingly inconsistent. The discrepancies
have been magnified, and dwelt upon by rationalizing
critics as a reason for regarding the accounts
as unhistorical. For a comparison of the
four narratives, a statement of the differences
between them, and a hypothetical harmony, see

in saying that all attempts at harmony are fruitless,
though certainly all harmonies are hypothetical,
and perhaps at best only show that
there is no radical and essential inconsistency in
the four narratives.</p>

<p><b>1-3.</b> Matthew says the women came “as it
began to dawn,” Mark “at the rising of the
sun.” John is the one most likely to have been
well informed, as he was the first one to whom
the women reported the facts; and his language,
therefore, is probably the most minutely accurate.
The time indicated by a comparison of the
three accounts is the early dawn, before the
sun was fairly up.—&#8203;With Mary Magdalene came Mary the mother of Joses, Salome, and apparently
Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 28:1; Mark 16:1; Luke 24:1, 10</span>). That John recognized
that there were more than one is indicated
by the use of the plural here in the report
made to the other disciples of the disappearance
of the Lord’s body: “We know not where they
have laid him.” Meyer, indeed, argues that the
reason borrowed from <em>we</em> know, in verse <a href="#ch20_2">2</a>, for
the plurality of the women at the grave, is outweighed
by <em>I</em> know, in verse <a href="#ch20_13">13</a>;
but this is fallacious,
for the fact that Mary was alone at the
grave when Jesus spoke to her would not prove,
nor even indicate, that she was alone when she
first came to it. On the contrary, it is evident
that she, with the other women, returned to the
city when they found the grave empty (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> <a href="#ch20_2">2</a>;
<abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 28:8; Luke 24:9</span>), and it is probable that

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
she returned again to the tomb, following Peter
and John, to sorrow there. For illustration of
sepulchre and rolling stone door, see notes on
Mark 16:2-4. For account of the rolling away
of the stone, see <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 28:2 and note. The report
of the women, <cite>They have taken away the
Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where
they have laid him</cite>, shows that they had no expectation
of the resurrection of their Lord, such
as rationalism has imputed to them in explaining
their belief in the resurrection appearances as
freaks of a sanguine and excited imagination.
They supposed that the grave had been robbed
by Christ’s enemies, and the body hidden; and,
in fact, this method of accounting for the disappearance
of the Lord’s body is to be found in
some of the later Jewish writings, though it has
never gained credence even among rationalistic
critics.</p>

<p><b>4-10.</b> This narrative bears the unmistakable
impress of coming from an eye-witness, and all the
commentators recognize its striking accordance
with the well-known characteristics of the two
disciples. The information, which from Matthew’s
and Luke’s accounts we should suppose
to have been given to all the disciples, appears
from John’s more minute narrative to have been
given only to Peter and John, for there is little
doubt that John refers to himself in the phrase
“the other disciple whom Jesus loved.” See
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch13_22">13:22</a>, note. They were both greatly excited
by the news of the supposed desecration
of the tomb, and hastened to the spot to see for
themselves. Mary Magdalene, as the sequel
shows, followed them more slowly.—&#8203;John, who
there is reason to believe was the younger, and
therefore not improbably the more agile of the
two, reached the sepulchre first, but was awed
at approaching the grave of his Lord, and waited
without, simply looking in through the open
door to assure himself that the tomb was really
empty.—&#8203;Peter, who was never hindered by his
sense of reverence, entered the sepulchre boldly
as soon as he arrived, and John followed him.
They found the tomb empty, but the winding-sheet
in which the body was wrapped
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch19_40">19:40</a>,
note</span>), and the napkin that was about the head,
were folded and laid in so orderly a manner as
to negative the opinion that the grave had been
rifled.—&#8203;The moment John saw the contents of
the tomb the truth flashed upon his mind. His
quick intuitions recalled and interpreted Christ’s
misunderstood prophecies of his own resurrection:
<em>he saw and believed</em>. To interpret this
phrase as meaning simply “he saw that the body
of Jesus was not there, and believed that it had
been removed, as Mary Magdalene had said”
(<cite>Bengel</cite>), is to do violence to the original, for
John habitually uses this word <cite>believed</cite> (<span lang="el">πιστεύω</span>)
of spiritual apprehension. Nor is there any
boast in the implication that he alone believed;
the fact is important, for we thus learn when the
faith in a risen Saviour first dawned on humanity;
and John could not state it more modestly.</p>

<p><b>11-13.</b> Mary, who apparently had followed
Peter and John to the sepulchre, remained after
their departure, to weep. She also stooped and
looked into the sepulchre, but she was so preoccupied
with the conclusion which she had already
hastily formed, that the orderly arrangement
of the grave-clothes produced no effect
upon her mind.—&#8203;For her some further disclosure
of the truth was necessary; to her, therefore,
the angels appeared. Mary is not startled either
at their appearance or their words (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> Luke 1:29</span>);
perhaps she is too entirely absorbed in her grief
at the disappearance of the Lord’s body.—&#8203;In answer
to their question she repeats what she had
reported to the disciples: “They (the Lord’s
enemies) have taken away my Lord, and I know
not where they have laid him.” It is by a very
forced accommodation that this text is applied
to or used to illustrate that philosophy which
denies the divinity and atonement of Christ; for
here it was the outward crucified tabernacle
which had been taken away, that the victorious
Spirit might be more effectively imparted. The
objection of rationalistic critics that the angels
had not been seen by Peter and John is well answered
by Godet: “Angels are not visible and
immovable, like stone statues.”</p>

<p><b>14, 15.</b> Mary turned back from looking into
the tomb, not attracted by any sound of Christ’s
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">approach—at</span> least of this there is no intimation

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
in the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">narrative—but</span> more probably in the very
restlessness of grief. Her failure to recognize
Jesus is best explained, not by any natural cause,
as the dimness of the morning light, or her inattention
to the person of the supposed stranger,
but by the analogous experience of the disciples
in their walk to Emmaus, when Christ appeared
to them “in another form” (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 16:12</span>), and
“their eyes were holden, that they should not
know him” (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 24:16</span>).—&#8203;Mary’s surmise that the
unknown was the gardener was a natural one.
“Who else could it be in the garden so early in
the morning?”—(<cite>Meyer.</cite>) The elaborate discussion
of the question whether he had on the
clothing of a gardener is a somewhat striking
illustration of the profitless and wholly fruitless
debate which is unhappily only too common in
Biblical interpretation. In the wildness of her
grief she surmised that the gardener might know
what had become of the body, might even have
taken part in its removal—a wild surmise, since
the tomb and the garden both belonged to a disciple
of Christ (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 27:60</span>). Her assurance, “I
will take him away,” is made in the strength of
a love which promises without reflecting whether
it can perform.</p>

<p><b>16-18.</b> Christ’s utterance of her name in well-remembered
accents disclosed him to her. She
had before but listlessly regarded him; she now
turned fully toward him, instantly recognized
him, responded to her name with a word full of
reverential affection—“<cite>Rabboni, Master</cite>”—&#8203;and
would have thrown herself at his feet and embraced
him but for his prohibition. In an instant
she was translated from the profoundest grief
to the most exalted ecstasy of love, but her intended
expression of that love did not accord
with that spiritual communion which the risen
Lord proposed to vouchsafe to his disciples.
The original rendered <cite>touch</cite> (<span lang="el">ἃπτω</span>) signifies literally
to hang upon some one. “She desired to
seize, grasp, hold Jesus, in order to enjoy his
society and to satisfy her love
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> Luke 7:36</span>).”—(<cite>Luthardt.</cite>)
Or, perhaps, to convince herself
that she was not under an illusion, and to hold
fast to the Christ whom she had already twice
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">lost—once</span> in the crucifixion, once in the disappearance
of the body from the tomb. There
appears to be an inconsistency between Christ’s
prohibition here and the statement in <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 28:9
that the women “came and held him by the
feet.” I believe the account there to be an
imperfect report of the event more accurately
reported here. See note on <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 28:9, 10.
Why the fact that Christ had not yet ascended
to his Father should be assigned as a reason for
not embracing him has given rise to much discussion
among the commentators. An account
of the explanations which have been afforded,
some of which are fanciful to the verge of absurdity,
may be found both in Luthardt and
Meyer. The true interpretation seems to me to
be this: Christ had promised to his disciples
that after he had gone to his Father he would
return to be with them, that they might be in
him and he in them, as he was in the Father and
the Father in him. This interpretation of his
death as a departure to be with the Father, and
this accompanying promise to return and be
with them, form the burden of his discourse in
John, <abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr> 14-16. He restrained Mary from
embracing him by declaring that he had not yet
gone to the Father, that the time for the fulfillment
of this promise of his fellowship had not
yet come, and that she must yet look forward to
the future for that intimacy of intercourse which
he had foretold. He did not stop to enter into
fuller explanations, but his words point to that
spiritual acquaintance with Christ to which Paul
gives expression in the declaration, “Though we
have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth
know we him no more” (<span class="muchsmaller">2 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 6:16</span>). But
though refusing to allow Mary to embrace him,
he conferred upon her a far greater honor in
commissioning her to be the first preacher of the
resurrection. By characterizing his disciples as
his <em>brethren</em>, he indicated that he was still in the
flesh. The body with which he had risen was
the same in which he was crucified. See Luke
24:39, note. The language of his message, “I
ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to
my God and your God,” indicates certainly that
the sonship of the disciple is not the same as the
sonship of the only begotten Son of God. He
does not say <em>our Father</em>. Cyril’s interpretation,
“My Father by nature; your Father by adoption,”

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
is just, though attributed to rather than
found in the words. The Father is by Paul
called “the God of our Lord Jesus Christ”

<p><b>19, 20.</b> Of this interview Mark gives a briefer,
Luke a quite different report (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 16:14-16; Luke
24:36-49</span>). As John was the only one of the Evangelists
present who has given any account of the
interview, it may be assumed that his is the
more accurate. It is possible that Luke’s account
of Christ’s eating broiled fish and a honeycomb,
to convince them that he was in the flesh,
may have been derived from the subsequent
interview in Galilee, reported by John in
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch21_12">21:12-14</a>. The event here recorded took place
after the appearance of Christ to the two disciples
in their walk to Emmaus (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 24:13-35</span>). This
was the first appearance of Christ, after the resurrection,
to the apostles in a body. The doors
were probably not only shut, but locked, as a
protection; the fear of the Jews was natural,
for it was reasonable to expect that the crucifixion
of the Master would be followed by an attempt
to pursue and punish the disciples; and
this natural expectation was increased by the
prophecies of persecution which formed a part
of Christ’s final instructions. The fact that
Jesus entered through the closed door does not
indicate that the body was other than the natural
body which had been laid in the grave;
and Christ’s language at this very time, as reported
by Luke, “A spirit hath not flesh and
bones, as ye see me have,” appears to be conclusive
that his resurrection body was his physical
body. It is as futile to ask how, with a natural
body, he could enter through the closed door,
as to ask how he could walk upon the water.
Miracles defy explanation. It is to be observed,
however, that the Evangelist does not state that
Jesus entered <em>through</em> the closed door. He simply
states the two facts which came within his
own observation: the doors were closed, and
while so closed, suddenly Jesus was seen standing
in the midst of the disciples, within the
room. The greeting, “<cite>Peace be unto you</cite>,” was a
common Jewish salutation. Like the salutation
“It is I, be not afraid,” with which Christ
greeted the frightened disciples in the storm-tossed
boat on the Sea of Galilee (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch6_20">6:20</a></span>), it was
addressed to calm their natural perturbation at
the sudden apparition. This it must have done
the more effectually in that it recalled to their
minds the benediction of his final discourse,
“Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto
you; not as the world giveth give I unto you”
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch14_27">14:27</a></span>). The showing of his hands and side
was further to convince them of his identity;
and it appears probable, from the language of
Thomas (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch20_25">25</a></span>), from the report of Luke (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke
24:39</span>), and from the language of John in his

<p><b>21.</b> This is John’s report of the commission
given by Christ to his disciples after the resurrection,
and should be compared with that of
Matthew (<span class="muchsmaller">28:18-20</span>), which, however, appears to
have been given later. Mark’s report of the
apostolic commission (<span class="muchsmaller">Mark 16:15-18</span>) is of doubtful
authenticity, and Luke’s account (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 24:45-49</span>) is
to be regarded rather as a summary of Christ’s
post-resurrection instructions than as the report
of any single commission. It is, as Meyer well
remarks, significant that the mission of the disciples
previously implied was formally and solemnly
ratified at the first meeting after the resurrection.
On the significance of this commission,
see <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#ch17_18">17:18</a>,

exhibition of gladness upon seeing him again,
and implied that their joy in their Lord was not
to be consummated until they had followed him
in his ministry of humiliation and sacrifice.</p>

<p><b>22, 23. He breathed on them and said,
Receive ye the Holy Ghost.</b> Breath is a
natural symbol of life; in the Bible it is used as
a symbol of the divine life. God breathes into
man the breath of life (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr> 2:7</span>); in the vision of
Ezekiel the wind breathes on the dry bones and
clothes them with life (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Ezekiel">Ezek.</abbr> 37:9, 10</span>); in Christ’s
conversation with Nicodemus the life-giving
power of God is compared to the breath of wind
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch3_8">3:8</a></span>); and it is significant of the extent to
which this symbol underlies Scripture that the
Greek word used for spirit is the one also used
for wind, which is poetically represented as the
breath of God. Here, by breathing on the apostles,
Christ symbolically imparted to them that
divine life which man never <em>acquires</em>, which God
alone can <em>give</em>. <cite>Receive ye the Holy Ghost</cite> is not
to be regarded as a promise to be fulfilled at
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">Pentecost—it</span> is not equivalent to, <cite>Ye shall receive
the Holy Ghost</cite>; nor as a full bestowal of the
power of the Spirit, which came not till Pentecost;

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
but as an <em>earnest</em> of the gift yet to be more
fully bestowed in successive endowments through
all the future ages of the church. This gift of
the Holy Ghost is to be connected with the commission
which precedes: “As my Father hath
sent me, even so I send you.” It is given to all
who accept this Christian commission, that is,
who believe in Christ through the word of the
apostles, and, believing, become true followers
of him. It is also to be connected with the authority
conferred in the verse which follows.
See below. There is a possible significance in
the omission of the definite article in the original,
which, if literally translated, would read,
Receive ye a holy spirit. We receive a spirit of
true holiness only as the divine life is breathed
upon us by the inspiration of God (<span class="muchsmaller">Titus 3:4-6</span>).—&#8203;<b>Whose
soever sins ye put away, they are
put away from them; whose soever sins
ye retain, they are retained.</b> This passage
is confessedly difficult of interpretation. In considering
it I endeavor, first, to put the English
reader in possession of the exact meaning of the
original; next, to suggest to him what seems to
me to be the true interpretation of the passage;
and finally to give him briefly other interpretations.
(1) The word rendered <cite>remit</cite> signifies primarily
and properly to <dfn>dismiss</dfn>, <dfn>put away</dfn>, <dfn>get rid
of</dfn>. As applied to sin in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>, it indicates
not a mere release from the threatened penalty
of transgression, but redemption from the power
of the sin itself. See <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 6:12, note. The
divine forgiveness of sins is interpreted by such
promises as those of Micah 7:19: “He will subdue
our iniquities, and thou wilt cast all their
sins into the depths of the sea;” and Isaiah 44:22:
“I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy
transgressions, and as a cloud thy sins.” In the
first clause of this verse, therefore, there is no
hint of any power in apostle or apostolic successor
to forgive sins, or to declare with authority
sins forgiven, or to declare under the inspiration
of the Holy Ghost to what character and on what
terms sins shall be forgiven. There is simply
the declaration that when the disciple of Christ,
acting under his Master’s commission and with
the power given by the inbreathed gift of the
Holy Ghost, does in fact put away, dismiss, get
rid of sin, in the individual or the community,
the work shall not be in vain in the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Lord—the</span>
devil so cast out shall not return to find the
house swept and garnished and take possession
of it again (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 12:44, 45</span>). The work shall abide.
Thus the first clause of this verse embodies a
promise like that of Isaiah 55:11, and is interpreted
by its fulfillment in Paul’s experience, as
in 1 <abbr title="Thessalonians">Thess.</abbr> 1:4-7. The second clause, <cite>Whose
soever sins ye retain shall be retained</cite>, is more difficult
of interpretation. The word rendered <cite>retain</cite>
primarily signifies to <dfn>possess power</dfn>, then to
<dfn>exercise</dfn> it. It is employed both in classic and
later Greek, with many derivative <span style="white-space:nowrap;">significations—to</span>
<dfn>rule</dfn>, <dfn>conquer</dfn>, <dfn>subdue</dfn>, <dfn>seize</dfn>, <dfn>keep</dfn>, <dfn>hold fast</dfn>. It
is translated in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> by the terms <dfn>hold</dfn> or
<dfn>hold fast</dfn>, <dfn>keep</dfn>, <dfn>lay hand on</dfn>, <dfn>obtain</dfn>, <dfn>take</dfn>, and, here
only, <dfn>retain</dfn>. It is sometimes used in a material
sense, that is, of the exercise of physical power,
as in <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 9:25, <cite>he took her by the hand</cite>, or <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr>
26:48, <cite>hold him fast</cite> (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="compare">comp.</abbr> verses 50, 55, 57</span>); sometimes
it is used in an immaterial sense, that is,
of the exercise of a mental power, as in <abbr title="Colossians">Col.</abbr> 2:19
of Christians who fall away from grace <em>not holding
the head</em>, or Mark 7:3 of the Pharisees who
<em>hold the traditions of the elders</em>. But it never loses
wholly its primary and germinant significance of
the possession and exercise of power. It cannot
therefore here be rendered, without a violation
of the original, <cite>Whose soever sins ye permit to retain
their hold on the sinner shall be allowed to be
retained</cite>; some real exercise of power on the
part of the person receiving the gift of the Holy
Ghost is indicated. There is also an antithesis
apparent in the original, as in our English version,
between the two clauses of the verse, <i>i. e.</i>,
between remitting or letting go and retaining or
not letting go. We have the same antithesis,
between the same words, though there used in a
physical sense, in Mark 12:12, They sought <em>to lay
hold</em> on him, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* but they <em>left</em> him and went
their way. It seems to me that by this latter
clause a power is conferred, the more awful that
it is not clearly, and perhaps cannot be by any
possibility clearly defined—a power to fasten sin
on the sinner by sentence of condemnation, as
there is power to put away sin by the proclamation
of the salvation. This power is given upon
the conditions implied in the commission, <cite>As the
Father hath sent me, even so I send you</cite>, and in the
gift, <cite>Receive ye the gift of the Holy Ghost</cite>; that is,
it is conferred, not on the apostles merely, all of
whom were not present (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch20_24">24</a></span>); nor on them and
their successors, for of successors the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> furnishes
no limit; nor on an ordained priesthood
or ministry; but on all who accept Christ’s commission,
and in that commission seek and obtain
the gift of the Holy Ghost; and it is theirs just
in the measure in which they receive and act
under his divine influence. (2) I read, then, in
this language of Christ, the bestowal of a twofold
spiritual <span style="white-space:nowrap;">power—one</span> of salvation, the other
of judgment. The disciple is sent into the world
as his Master was sent into the world, like him
to become a teacher of divine truth, an example
to others, a manifestation of the divine character,
a bearer in his own person of the sins of
others. See <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_18">17:18</a>, note. But also like him
he is to be a judge. The Master’s fan is to be in
his hand. He who has power to proclaim salvation
has also authority to pronounce condemnation,
and the one declaration no less than the

other, when uttered under the influence of the
Holy Spirit of God, is uttered with divine authority.
Instances of this judgment against
wilful and determined sin are afforded by Christ’s
denunciation of the Pharisees; by Peter’s condemnation
of Ananias and Sapphira, and of Simon
Magus; by Paul’s judgment against the
offender in the church of Corinth. Illustrations
of perversions of this power are afforded by
the anathemas of the church of the middle ages,
and perhaps by some of the severe denunciations
of the Puritans. It has been variously illustrated
by preachers of judgment from the days
of Jeremiah to those of John Knox. Such a
sentence, when uttered, as it often has been,
under the influence of malign passion, or of
ecclesiastical ambition, is but an ill-spent breath;
but when it is the voice of a spirit of truth and
holiness, aroused to righteous indignation in the
presence of inveterate sin, and is uttered by a
soul acting under the conscious influence of the
Divine Spirit, the sentence becomes an awful
one, because it is an echo of the inaudible sentence
of God himself. I must add emphasis to
the statement that, as I read this passage, this
power belongs, not to a hierarchy, priesthood,
or ministry, but to the Christian soul, by virtue
of its direct life in and with God, and to such
soul only when acting in its highest moods and
with the direct and conscious influence of the
Spirit of God upon it. This authority, here bestowed
on all who are inspired by a divinely imparted
spirit of holiness, interprets and measurably
explains the power of a holy soul, before
which often, in the history of the race, the most
august personages have trembled, they knew
not why. Of course this interpretation will be
at once rejected by those who would abolish
judgment from eternity, much more from this
present life, and treat sin only as an immaturity
or a disease; but possibly the church would be
more efficient in its proclamation of the gospel
to penitent sinners, if its spirit of holiness were
sometimes aroused to pronounce the sentence of
God against persistent sin; perhaps it would call
to the Lord more of the publicans and sinners, if
it had more of his spirit of judgment against the
temple traders and the Pharisees. (3) The principal
other interpretations of this passage are the
following: (<i>a</i>) That the Lord gave power to the
apostles to absolve men from sin and fasten sin
upon them, but that this was a purely personal
power, belonging to the apostolic age, and ceasing
with the gifts of miracles, of tongues, etc.
But this interpretation dissociates the power
here conferred from the accompanying commission
and gift, or confines the latter to the apostles,
while the general teaching of the Scriptures
gives both to all believers. See <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch17_18">17:18</a>, <a href="#ch17_20">20</a>;
Acts 2:38, 39. It would exclude Thomas, who
was not present at this interview, and Paul, who
was not one of the eleven. (<i>b</i>) That a power of
infallibly absolving and anathematizing is here
conferred, but that it belongs exclusively to the
apostles and their successors, the self-perpetuating
hierarchy. This is the ecclesiastical view,
held very generally by the Roman Catholic
church, and in a modified form by many among
the hierarchical denominations generally. But
there is neither here nor anywhere else in the
<abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> any hint of any power in the apostles to
appoint successors, nor any hint that they ever
did so. And indeed the very nature of their
office, which was to bear personal witness to the
facts of Christ’s life and death and resurrection,
was such that in the nature of the case no successors
were possible (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch15_27">15:27</a>; Acts 1:21, 22; 1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr>
9:1; 15:8</span>). On this point the dictum of an English
dean is significant: “This gift belongs to the
church in all ages, and especially to those who
by legitimate appointment are set to minister in
the churches of Christ: not by successive delegation
from the apostles, <em>of which fiction I find in
the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> no trace</em>, but by their mission from
Christ, the bestower of the spirit for their office,
when orderly and legitimately conferred upon
them by the various churches. Not, however,
to them exclusively, though for decency and
order it is expedient that the outward and formal
declaration should be so; but in proportion
as <em>any disciple</em> shall have been filled with the
holy spirit of wisdom is the inner discernment
his.”—(<cite>Alford.</cite>) (<i>c</i>) The power here promised is
one which in a very general way accompanies the
preaching of the gospel; that it is a promise that
“they should be taught by the Holy Ghost to
declare on what terms, to what characters, and
to what temper of mind God would extend forgiveness
of sins.” This, which is Mr. Barnes’s
interpretation, seems to me entirely inadequate.
It reduces a definite and positive promise of divine
ratification of human judgment, under the
guidance of the Holy Spirit, to a mere enunciation
of the general principle that the ministers
of Christ shall be ministers of the truth. (<i>d</i>)
That the two clauses of the sentence are, the
one a promise, the other a warning; that Christians
<em>remit</em> sin when, by their influence, their
example, or their teaching, they induce sinners
to repent of sin and abandon it; that they <em>retain</em>
sin when, by their negligence, their acquiescence,
or their approval, they directly or indirectly
help to fasten sins on the individual or the community;
and that Christ promises his disciples
great results if they are faithful, and warns
them of equally great but terrible results if they
are remiss or culpable. The original does not
seem to me capable of this rendering, for it ignores
the fundamental meaning of the word rendered
<cite>retain</cite> (<span lang="el">κρῦέω</span>), which always indicates some

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
real <dfn>exercise of power</dfn>, never a failure or a neglect
to exercise it. See above. The view which I
have adopted is not very widely different from
that of Alford, Meyer, Ryle, Calvin, Watkins,
and the best of the Protestant commentators
generally, except that, with Godet, I regard the
promise as conferring on the moral judgments
of the disciple a real efficacy, while the commentators
generally regard it as simply a promise
of wisdom spiritually to perceive and declare
judgments which shall be in accordance with the
divine will. This interpretation is also adopted
by some of the more evangelical of the Roman
Catholic divines, <i>e. g.</i>, Quesnel in modern and
Chrysostom in ancient times, both of whom regard
the priest as an ambassador of God, and as
speaking by authority only in so far as he is filled
with the Holy Ghost. “But why speak I of
priests? Neither angel nor archangel can do
anything with regard to what is given him of
God; but the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost dispenseth all, while the priest lends his
tongue and affords his hand.”—(<cite>Chrysostom.</cite>)
“That such a judgment may be pronounced
upon sinners as is fit to be approved of God, and
to be confirmed in heaven, it must be such as is
according to the Spirit of God, who is given for
that purpose, and to the rules prescribed by
Christ to sinners, of which the priest is only the
minister.”—(<cite>Quesnel.</cite>)</p>

<p><b>24, 25.</b> Didymus is the Greek equivalent of
Thomas, which is of Hebrew origin. Very little

(<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch11_16">11:16</a>;
<a href="#ch14_5">14:5</a></span>) indicate
an affectionate spirit but a skeptical intellect,
a man who loved much, but believed and
hoped but little. He has been well called “the
rationalist” among the twelve; but he was a
rationalist with a warm heart. The incident
here recorded shows that the fact of the resurrection
was so attested that it was accepted by
one who could only be convinced by the clearest
and most convincing proof. The reason of
Thomas’s absence is not stated, nor even implied;
but the conjecture that he had abandoned hope,
and therefore the companionship of the disciples,
is not unreasonable.—&#8203;His language, <cite>Except
I thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe</cite>, is
that not merely of dejection, but also of defiance.
His position is that of modern positivism,
which refuses to believe anything not verified by
actual sensuous observation; his demand is that
of M. Renan, who, to substantiate the doctrine
of the resurrection, calls for the successful raising
of the dead before a commission composed of
physiologists, physicians, chemists, and skilled
critics. See <cite>Life of Jesus</cite>, <abbr title="Introduction">Intro.</abbr> But Thomas’s

<p><b>26, 27.</b> This meeting after eight days, <i>i. e.</i>,
on the eighth day, is the first intimation in the
<abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> of a commemoration by the disciples of the
resurrection; and there is nothing to show that
the disciples had not kept together in a continuous
meeting during the entire week, which, it
will be remembered, was the Passover week.
But it is certainly significant that Christ chose
the first day of the week, on which he rose from
the dead, to make his second appearance to his
infant church, and thus gave an impulse to, if
not a suggestion of, that apostolic commemoration
of the day, which by insensible degrees led
to the transfer of the Christian’s weekly festival
from the seventh to the first day of the week.—&#8203;Christ appears as suddenly and mysteriously as
before, and in his address to Thomas echoes his
words, a severe yet a tender and loving rebuke.
The evidence which he would have refused to
the Pharisee he grants to the disciple; the inimical
demand of the determined skeptic he always
disregards; for the intellectual difficulties
of a reluctant skeptic he shows great compassion.
But he shows this compassion for unbelief
that he may rescue the unbeliever from it, and
bids him <em>become not unbelieving, but believing</em>.
Through his doubt of the actual occurrence of
the resurrection, Thomas was in danger of becoming
a disbeliever generally, and against this
danger of lapsing from a state of faith to one of
unfaith Jesus warned Thomas, and through him
warns the feeble and vacillating believers of all
ages.</p>

<p><b>28, 29.</b> Thomas was overpowered and convinced
by the grace of his Master, not by the
physical evidence which he had demanded, and
which was vouchsafed to him; not because he
handled, but because he <em>saw</em>, he believed
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch20_29">29</a></span>).
In this appears the difference of his spirit from
that of the modern rationalists; his faith finally
rested, not in the sensuous evidence, but in the
invisible love and mercy of his Lord. The mere

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
fact that Jesus rose from the dead did not demonstrate
his divinity, nor give ground for Thomas’s
appeal; for Lazarus, too, rose from the dead.
“It was an evidence addressing itself not to his
eyes, but to his heart, which forced him to cry,
My Lord and my God.”—(<cite>Maurice.</cite>) To interpret
this utterance as a mere expletory outcry
is the shallowest of criticism. It reduces a sublime
and exalted confession of faith to an irrelevant
and semi-profane exclamation. It is grammatically,
psychologically, and spiritually untenable;
grammatically, because it is expressly said
that Thomas addressed the words to Jesus—&#8203;<em>he said “unto him”</em>; psychologically, because it is
equally irrational to suppose that Thomas, just
convinced of the resurrection of his Lord and
Master, should break out into a mere meaningless
exclamation, or that John should have reported
it if it had been uttered; spiritually, because
Christ on the strength of this confession
of Thomas recognizes his faith: “Thou hast
believed.” Equally untenable is the suggestion
of Norton (<cite>Notes on the Gospels</cite>), that “the name
God was employed by him, not as the proper
name of the Deity, but as an appellation, according
to a common use of it in his day,” for no
such common use existed, and its existence
would have been utterly inconsistent with the
Hebrew laws against the use of God’s name in
vain. The fact that Thomas recognized Jesus as
both Lord and God might not of itself be conclusive;
there would be possible ground for
Norton’s argument: “Considering into how
great an error he had fallen in his previous obstinate
incredulity, there would be little reason
for relying upon his opinion as infallible”; but
Christ not only accepts, he distinctly approves
and ratifies Thomas’s confession, and the faith
of the church rests not on the words of the disciple,
but on their approbation by his Lord.
Thomas’s words here, then, are to be read in the
light of Christ’s words in <abbr title="chapters">chaps.</abbr>
<a href="#CHAPTER_XIII">13-17</a>; the disciple
accepts in a single sentence Christ’s teaching
respecting himself as the one sent from and
manifesting to the world the eternal Father. It
is the answer of a suddenly awakened faith to
the before ill-comprehended declaration, He that
hath seen me hath seen the Father. In his response,
<cite>Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet
have believed</cite>, Jesus recognizes two kinds of belief,
one which rests on seeing or on the witness of
those that have seen, the other and higher that
which rests simply on spiritual apprehension.
Parallel to the implied contrast here is that in
John <a href="#ch14_11">14:11</a>, “Believe me that I am in the Father,
and the Father in me; or else believe me
for the very work’s sake.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><a id="Note_ch21"></a><span class="smcap">Preliminary Note.</span>—All modern critics agree
in regarding this chapter as in the nature of a
supplement, the original Gospel having been
brought to a close in the last verses of the preceding
chapter. This opinion is based chiefly
upon the formal close afforded by those verses.
That this supplemental chapter was written at a
very early period, and probably before the Gospel
itself was given to the public, is indicated
by the fact that it is found in all the manuscripts.
Whether it was written by John himself or by some
disciple or friend is not altogether clear, and certainly
not very important; but the evangelical
critics generally agree, from a careful consideration
of its internal characteristics, in attributing it
to John himself. Thus Alford: “The reader will
have perceived in the foregoing comment on the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
chapter a manifest leaning to the belief that it was
written by John himself. <em>Of this I am fully convinced.</em>
In every part of it his hand is plain and
unmistakable; in every part of it his character
and spirit is manifested in a way which none but
the most biassed can fail to recognize. I believe
it to have been added some years probably after
the completion of the Gospel; partly, perhaps,
to record the important miracle of the second
draught of fishes, so full of spiritual instruction,
and the interesting account of the sayings of the
Lord to Peter; but principally to meet the error
which was becoming prevalent concerning himself.”
To the same effect Meyer: “In accordance
with all that has been advanced, the view
is justified that John, by way of authentic historical
explanation of the legend in <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch21_23">23</a>, some
time after finishing his Gospel, which he had
closed with <a href="#ch20_31">20:31</a>, wrote
<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> <a href="#CHAPTER_XXI">21:1-24</a> as a complement
of the book, and that this appendix,
simply because its Johannean character was immediately
certain and recognized, already at a
very early period, whilst the Gospel had not yet
issued forth from the narrower circle of its first
readers, had become an inseparable part of the
Gospel.” Similarly, though somewhat more
doubtfully, Luthardt and Godet. See also

<p><b>1-3.</b> The departure of the disciples into Galilee
is not to be regarded as an abandonment on
their part of hope; for Christ’s direction to his
disciples after his resurrection was to go into
Galilee and meet him there (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 28:7; Mark 16:7</span>).
We are rather to regard it, therefore, as an evidence
that they were convinced by his repeated
appearances of the resurrection of their Lord,
and went into Galilee in anticipation of meeting

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
him there. For the same reason we are not to
regard Peter’s declaration, <cite>I go a fishing</cite>, as an
indication that he had abandoned his sacred for
a secular calling. His restless temperament did
not allow him to wait in inactivity, and he sought
relief in work. The response of the other disciples,
<cite>We also go with thee</cite>, has been rightly used
by the homiletical commentators as an illustration
of the influence of example. John was one
of the sons of Zebedee. Assuming that the 21st
chapter is from his pen, we have in it the description
of an eye-witness. There is nothing to
indicate who were the two unnamed disciples,
but the fact that they are unnamed has been
regarded as an indication that they were not two
of the twelve. The <em>ship</em> was, of course, simply a
fisherman’s boat, probably not very different in
shape and size from those to be seen in the Sea
of Galilee at the present day, as represented in
the accompanying illustration.</p>

<p><b>4, 5.</b> The night of labor spent in vain might
naturally have recalled to the disciples that
other night of toil after which Christ first called
some of these disciples to be his followers (Luke
5:1-11). In the gray twilight they saw a stranger
on the shore; that they did not recognize
him may have been due in part to the dimness
of the early light, but more probably to the fact,
illustrated by other post-resurrection appearances,
that he was recognized only as he chose
to reveal himself (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch20_14">20:14</a>; Luke 24:16</span>). Certainly
it indicates that the disciples had no such expectation
of his appearance as would lead them, according
to the theory of M. Renan, to conjure
up a spectre. There is nothing in the words,
and we may presume there was nothing in the
tones of Jesus, to quicken their perception. His
language is that of a fisherman: <cite>Boys</cite> (<span lang="el">παιδία</span>),
<cite>have ye no fish?</cite> The word rendered <cite>meat</cite> (<span lang="el">προσφάγιον</span>)
is literally <dfn>what is eaten therewith</dfn>, <i>i. e.</i>,
with bread, and here is equivalent to <dfn>fish</dfn>, which
in Galilee was a common accompaniment of
bread in the peasant’s meal.</p>

suppose that he had perceived indications of
a school of fishes there.—&#8203;In the effect produced
on the two disciples, Peter and John, by the
miraculous draught of fishes which followed,
the character of each is strikingly illustrated.
John, with his quicker intuitions, recalling that
other fishing scene, recognized the Lord first;
Peter, with his greater boldness to act, leaped
into the water, and partly swam and partly
waded ashore. <abbr title="Compare">Comp.</abbr>

garment, like the workmen’s

laid off during his night’s work.
This he put on, counting it unseemly

found a fire of coals already kindled, and some
fish laid thereon, and some loaves of <span style="white-space:nowrap;">bread—in</span>
short, preparation for a simple meal. There has

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
been some unprofitable discussion among the
commentators respecting the manner in which
this provision had been made. It is attributed
by different commentators to the ministry of
angels, to the activity of Peter, to the forethought
of Jesus. Alford, following Stier and the older
commentators, insists that it was miraculously
provided. Trench rightly and briefly disposes
of this question: “By what ministry, natural or
miraculous, has been often inquired, but we
must leave this undetermined, as we find it.”
The provision apparently was not sufficient for
the company, for Christ bade Peter add to the
stock from the fish just caught. Peter went,
therefore, to aid the others in bringing the net
to shore. The fish were counted, and the exact
number is recorded by the Evangelist. The attempt
to draw some spiritual lessons from this
number affords a curious illustration of the absurdities
into which the allegorizing method is
liable to carry the student. The exact enumeration
is important only because it is an indication
of accuracy in the historian; in such an enumeration
there is no opportunity for the exaggeration
of imagination. To me Augustine’s allegorical
interpretation of the contrast between this and
the analogous yet widely different miracle recorded
in Luke 5:1-11 is scarcely more profitable
than the spiritualizing interpretation of the
meaning of the one hundred and fifty-three; the
curious in such matters will find it fully reported
in Trench on the Parables. It might be possible
to account for each single feature in this narrative
without assuming a miracle; but in a candid
consideration of all the features <span style="white-space:nowrap;">combined—the</span>
fruitless fishing all night, the sudden and extraordinary
success in the morning, the number of
fish, their size, the unbroken net, though dragged
full of fish to the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">shore—it</span> is impossible to doubt
that we have here, what evangelical critics have
always seen in the narrative, the account of a
miraculous manifestation of the Lord’s power.</p>

<p><b>12-14.</b> There is a verbal, but no real inconsistency
in the statement that <cite>none of the disciples
durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was
the Lord</cite>. “But seeing that His form was altered,
and full of much awfulness, they were
greatly amazed, and desired to ask somewhat
concerning It; but fear, and their knowledge
that He was not some other, but the same,
checked their inquiry.”—(<cite>Chrysostom.</cite>) The careful
student will observe that the Evangelist
does not characterize this as the third appearance
of Jesus, but as the third appearance <em>to his
disciples</em>, <i>i. e.</i>, the apostles. This excludes the
appearance to Mary (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch20_16">20:16</a></span>), and to the two
disciples on the walk to Emmaus (<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 24:13-35</span>);
the two preceding appearances referred to were
that to the ten on the evening of the day of the
resurrection (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch20_19">20:19</a></span>) and that to the eleven in
the week following (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch20_26">20:26</a></span>). Without following
the allegorizing commentators into any of
their extravagances, we may reasonably see, with
Alford, Trench, and others, a spiritual significance
in the fact that Christ provided a meal for
the apostles at the same time when, by this new
miraculous draught, he reminded them of their
first call to become fishers of men, thus suggesting
to them the spiritual truth involved in the
Lord’s Supper, and symbolically represented in
the feeding of the five thousand, that they who
minister in the things of Christ are themselves
dependent on Christ for their spiritual support;
perhaps also suggesting that when the labor of
life is over there will be for them that have
wrought for Christ a feast with him in the kingdom
of heaven. But certainly Trench goes too
far in saying that “the character of the meal was
sacramental, and it had nothing to do with the
stilling of their present hunger.” It is much
more reasonable to see in this provision for the
disciples’ commonest <span style="white-space:nowrap;">needs—food</span> and a fire at
the end of a night of sleepless toil—a new illustration
of the tenderness of Christ’s consideration
for his own.</p>

suggest to the English reader, though inadequately,
points of difference in the original which
our English translation wholly fails to preserve,
possibly through the inattention of the translators,
but more probably through the inadequacy
of the English language to represent delicate
shades of meaning which are represented
by the Greek. (1) Two different Greek words
are rendered indiscriminately <dfn>love</dfn> (<span lang="el">φιλέω</span> and
<span lang="el">ἀγαπάω</span>). I have attempted to indicate the difference
by rendering the one to <dfn>love</dfn> and the
other to <dfn>have affection</dfn>, though this rather suggests
that there is a difference than indicates in
what it consists. The word which Christ uses in
his question, <cite>Lovest thou me?</cite> (<span lang="el">ἀγαπάω</span>), signifies,
if not the higher, at least the more thoughtful
and reverential affection, founded on an intelligent
estimate of character, and accompanied by
a deliberate and well-considered choice. Peter’s
<cite>I love thee</cite> represents rather the personal instinctive
love, the activity of feeling rather than of
will, the affection which, being spontaneous and
instinctive, gives no account of itself, and no
reason for its existence. We are bid in the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr>
to exercise the first form of love (<span lang="el">ἀγαπάω</span>) towards
God, but never the second; while the Father
is said to exercise both forms towards his
own Son. Two different Greek words are also
rendered indiscriminately <dfn>feed</dfn>. To indicate the
difference I have rendered one by the rare but
indispensable verb <dfn>shepherd</dfn>. Finally, three
words are used to represent the flock which
Christ commends to Peter’s care—<dfn>lambs</dfn> (<span lang="el">ἀρνία</span>),
<dfn>sheep</dfn> (<span lang="el">πρόβατά</span>), and <dfn>little sheep</dfn> (<span lang="el">προβάτιά</span>). There
is some uncertainty as to the reading, but the
one I have followed is accepted by the best
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">critics—Alford,</span> Meyer, etc. To <dfn>feed</dfn> the sheep
is simply to nourish them; to <dfn>shepherd</dfn> them is
not in contrast the ruling activity (so <cite>Meyer</cite>), but
the whole shepherd care of the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">flock—watching</span>,
tending, <span style="white-space:nowrap;">leading—as</span> illustrated in Psalm 23 and
in John <a href="#ch10_1">10:1-18</a>. The term <cite>lamb</cite> is never used in
the <abbr title="New Testament">N. T.</abbr> except of Christ himself
(<span class="muchsmaller">John <a href="#ch1_29">1:29</a>;
1 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr>
1:19; <abbr title="Revelation">Rev.</abbr> 5:6, 8, 12, etc.</span>), or of the followers of Christ
(<span class="muchsmaller">Luke 10:3</span>). By the <cite>lambs</cite> here, then, I understand
Christ to mean his professed followers;
Peter was to show his love for the Master by
teaching them. The term <cite>sheep</cite> is more general,
and includes in the figurative language of the
Bible those who have wandered away from the
fold of God (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 9:36; 12:11, 12; 15:24; Luke 15:4-6</span>).
Peter is to show his love for the Master, not only
by teaching the Lord’s disciples, but by shepherding
the sheep, whether in the fold or wandering
from it, as a good shepherd going before
them, going after them, giving his life, if need
be, for them (<span class="muchsmaller">John
<a href="#ch10_1">10:1-13</a></span>). The <dfn>little sheep</dfn> are
the young, who have not yet wandered away,
and whom he is to keep in the Master’s fold by
feeding them there with the herbage of life.
Christ calls them <em>my</em> lambs, <em>my</em> sheep, because
the Father has given all to him, and he is, as
Redeemer and Saviour, Lord of all. The most
superficial student will not fail to see in this
thrice-repeated question an indirect and implied
reference to and recall of the thrice-repeated
denial of his Lord by Peter. In his request for
permission to walk on the water, in his protest
against the feet-washing, in his assertion
“Though all men shall be offended because of
thee, yet will I never be offended” (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> 14:28;
26:33; John <a href="#ch13_8">13:8</a></span>), there are indications of an overweening
self-confidence in his love for the Lord as
greater than that of the other disciples. It was
this self-confidence in the strength of his love
which had proved his danger. Christ addresses
him, not by his new name of Peter, but by the
old name which he bore before he knew the Lord,
and asks him, Hast thou for me a greater love
than these? Peter, saying nothing of the love of
the others, not even venturing to claim for himself
the intelligent and deliberate love which
rules the life and molds the character, answers
in humility: Thou knowest my affection for
thee. Show it then, says Jesus, not by assuming
pre-eminence over my flock, but by becoming
their shepherd (= <dfn>servant</dfn>, <abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch13_12">13:12-17</a>). He then
repeats the question, Lovest thou me? Peter
answers as before: Thou knowest my affection
for thee. Show it then, says Christ, by shepherding
my sheep; by seeking the lost, restoring
the wanderer. A third time he asks the question,
now changing it and adopting Peter’s own
language: Art thou sure of thine affection for
me? Peter is grieved, at the <em>change</em> in the question
as well as at its repetition, “because he said
unto him the third time, <cite>Hast thou affection for
me?</cite>” and appeals to him as the Searcher of
hearts to witness for himself the depth and reality
of his affection. And Christ finally bids him

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
show his love by feeding the little <span style="white-space:nowrap;">sheep—the</span>
young, the feeble, those most needing care.
Meyer well notes the fact that Christ does not
question Peter’s <em>faith</em>, but the love which proceeds
from faith and shows itself by its work;
and Godet notes the curious resemblance between
the present situation and that of two
scenes in the previous life of Peter with which it
is related. He had been called to the ministry
by Jesus after a miraculous draught of fishes;
it is after a similar draught that the ministry is
restored to him. He had lost his office by his
denial beside a fire of coals; it is beside a fire of
coals that he recovers it.—&#8203;(<cite>Godet.</cite>) The ecclesiastical
commentators see in this scene a reinstatement
of Peter in his apostolic office, to which
Alford well replies that “there is no record of
his ever having lost it.” The R. C. divines find
in it a proof-text for their belief in the primacy
of Peter; to which Peter himself furnishes a
quite adequate reply in 1 <abbr title="Peter">Pet.</abbr> 5:1-3. The shepherd
is not a lord over God’s heritage, but one
who follows the Chief Shepherd, goes before the
flock, is their example and their leader, by his
own life showing them the way to live, and, if
need be, by his own death for their sakes showing
them how to die. It must strike one, too,
as curious that Peter should be grieved at words
which constitute him the head of the church
and the vicar of God upon earth. The true lesson
of this scene is for all the disciples of Christ.
We are all, through Peter’s experience, admonished
to show our love for our Master, not by
asking permission to do great things (as to walk
on the waves), not by refusing to accept his
humiliation for us (as by refusing to allow the
feet-washing), nor yet by professing what we
will do in the hour of difficulty and danger (as
by the assurance, “I will not deny thee”), nor
even by entering into fierce battle against his
foes (as by drawing the sword on Malchus), but
by laying down the life in quiet, humble, self-denying
service for the Master’s <span style="white-space:nowrap;">sheep—the</span> followers
of Christ, the wanderers from the fold,
and the weakest and feeblest in the fold.</p>

<p><b>18, 19.</b> In this language, <cite>when thou wast young
thou girdedst thyself</cite>, there is perhaps a reference
to Peter’s act in girding himself and casting himself
into the sea (<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr>
<a href="#ch21_7">7</a></span>). The prophecy foretells
the manner of his death, which, according to an
early and apparently trustworthy tradition, was
by crucifixion at about the same time with Paul,
in the persecutions under Nero. According to
Origen, Peter was crucified with his head downwards,
either by his own request, because in his
humility he was unwilling to suffer the same
death as his Lord, or by order of Nero, as matter
of wanton and ingenious cruelty. The contrast
between Peter’s experience in his youth and in
his old age is one common in Christian experience,
a contrast between <em>doing</em> and <em>suffering</em>, between
active, energetic service of the Lord and
the patient endurance of his cross. Both are
involved in following Christ. To interpret this
command, <cite>Follow me</cite>, literally, as Godet: “Jesus
began to move off, and commanded Peter to follow
him in the literal sense, and John followed
them without any express invitation,” seems to
me a shallow interpretation, which is not helped
by supposing it to be a symbolical act, a sort of
childish object-teaching. Peter had gone back to
his fishing; in saying <cite>Follow me</cite>, Christ calls him
again to become a fisher of men, by the same
phrase which he had employed three years before
on the shore of the same sea and after a similar
miracle.</p>

<p><b>20, 21.</b> It is not necessary, and it is hardly

the natural and almost universal tendency to
inquire into the duty and destiny of others. The
Lord’s reply indicates what is the answer which he
would make to us whenever we, following Peter’s
doubtful example, pry curiously into his purposes
respecting others.</p>

<p><b>22, 23.</b> It is curious to see how Christ’s language
here, notwithstanding John’s interpretation,
has been misconstrued, even down to the
latest time, as a promise, or a quasi-promise,
that John should tarry until the second coming
of Christ. Ancient legends report that after his
interment there were strange movements in the
earth that covered him, that when the tomb was
subsequently opened it was found empty, that
he was reserved to reappear again in conflict with
Anti-Christ; so late as the sixteenth century an
enthusiast was burned at Toulouse who gave
himself out as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John; and even so sober a

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
commentator as Godet submits, though hesitatingly,
the hypothesis that, as the primitive epoch
of humanity had its Enoch, and the theocratic
epoch its Elijah, neither of whom knew death,
so also the Christian epoch may have had its
deathless representative. Two other interpretations
are: (1) That Christ refers here to his
coming to his own in their death, and that by
the phrase <cite>If I will that he tarry till I come</cite> he
means, If I will that he meet a natural death
instead of martyrdom. This interpretation Alford
justly characterizes as frigid and inapplicable
here, since martyrdom is as truly a coming
of the Lord as natural death. (2) That by his
Second Coming, Christ refers to the destruction
of Jerusalem, an interpretation strangely adopted
by Alford. That destruction was an historical
prophecy, but in no wise an historical fulfillment
of the promise of the Lord’s Second Coming.
There is no reason for regarding this language of
Christ as anything else than purely hypothetical,
equivalent to, <dfn>Suppose that I were to will that he
should remain upon the earth unto the end; what
would that be to thee?</dfn></p>

<p><b>24, 25.</b> There is uncertainty respecting the
authorship and authenticity of these verses. For
discussion of this question, see <cite>Smith’s <abbr title="Bible Dictionary">Bib. Dict.</abbr></cite>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 1430, note <i>b</i>; <cite>Godet’s Commentary</cite>, <abbr title="Volume Three">Vol. III</abbr>,
<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 362, 363. The verses are found in all the
manuscripts, except that Tischendorf believes
that <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 25 was originally wanting in the Sinaitic
<abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr>; he thinks that the color of the ink and a
slight difference in the handwriting show that it
did not proceed from the original scribe, but was
added by a contemporary reviser. But though
there is no external evidence for setting either
verse aside, the internal evidence seems to me decisive
against verse 25. “This inharmonious and
unspiritual exaggeration” (<cite>Meyer</cite>) is entirely inconsistent
with John’s scrupulously simple and
truthful narrative. The authorship of <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 24 is
more uncertain. Whether written by John, or
added almost immediately after by some companion,
it affords a very strong attestation of the
apostolic authorship of the Fourth Gospel. On a
careful examination of the different authorities, it
seems to me that Godet’s conclusion, though hypothetical,
is in accordance with probabilities,
and his deduction respecting the authenticity of
the Gospel as a whole is irresistible: “1st. That
the narrative (<span class="muchsmaller">verses 1-23</span>) is from the hand of the
Evangelist. <abbr title="second">2d.</abbr> That <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 24 is a declaration emanating
from the friends of John, who had called
forth the composition of his Gospel, and to
whom he had committed it after its completion.
<abbr title="third">3d.</abbr> That <abbr title="verse">ver.</abbr> 25 is written by one of them, with
whom the work was deposited, and who thought
himself bound to close it thus, to the glory, not
of the author, but of the subject of history. By
these last words the entire work becomes a
whole. Accordingly we are shut up to hold
either that John is the author of our Gospel, or
that the author is a forger, who, 1st, palmed
himself off on the world with all the characteristics
of the apostle; who, <abbr title="second">2d</abbr>, carried his shamefulness
so far that he got made out for him, by
an accomplice of his fraud, a certificate of identity
with the person of John; or who, more
simply still, to save himself the trouble of finding
a companion in falsehood, made out this
certificate for himself in the name of another, or
of several others. And he who had recourse to
such ways was the author of a writing in which
lying is blasted as the work of the devil
(<span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<a href="#ch8_44">8:44</a></span>),
and truth glorified as one of the two essential
features of the divine character! If any one

it” (<span class="muchsmaller">1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> 14:38</span>).</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Two</span> years have elapsed since the publication
of the preceding volume in this series of
Commentaries on the books of the New Testament.
A considerable part of the Commentary
on John was then already written; all that part
of it which was common to the Four Gospels was
substantially ready for the printer; little else
remained to be written except that portion which
dealt with the larger discourses of our Lord, and
not all of that; and a life-long study of the Four
Gospels, part of the results of which had been
given to the public in a Life of Christ, and others
of which were in manuscript notes, had made me
measurably familiar with the ground that lay
before me. But the discourses of Jesus, as recorded
by John, can be studied only meditatively.
A certain quiet restfulness of mind is essential to
any spiritual apprehension of their meaning.
And I have believed that those to whom this
volume had been earlier promised, and whose
impatience at the delay has reached me in letters
that have always been kindly and courteous and
full of encouragement, would easier pardon delay
than despoiling haste in preparation. I can ask
no leniency of any critic on the ground that time
was wanting to do adequately the needful work.</p>

<p>I have stated in the introduction the reasons
which have led me, after a careful, and I believe
a measurably impartial, study of the question, to
believe that the Fourth Gospel is the work of the
apostle John, and that he is the one designated
in that Gospel as “the disciple whom Jesus
loved.” I wish to add here, emphatically, that
the meditative study of the discourses which
John has reported has strengthened that conviction.
Either we have here the truths which
Christ taught, reported by one who lived after
the spiritual and catholic character of Christianity
had begun to show itself by its actual development,
and who therefore comprehended his
profounder instructions as they were not comprehended
during his lifetime; or else we must
believe that the centuries immediately succeeding
the first of the Christian era produced a
spiritual genius whose insight into the profoundest
truths of human experience, when inflamed
into more than merely human life by the inbreathing
of God, makes him the equal if not the superior
of the Jesus portrayed in the three synoptic
Gospels, and yet one who has been utterly
unknown to fame, and who has left no other
monument to his memory than a document that
is a fraud if not a forgery. The skepticism that
asserts this lays too heavy a tax on human credulity.
It asks us to believe not only in a Socrates
who had no Plato to reveal his teachings and
his influence, but in one who did not hesitate to
employ a petty and useless fraud as a setting for
the most transcendent spiritual truth.</p>

<p>This truth may be expressed in two words as
that of the Divine Immanence. Around this the
whole Gospel of John centres; to illustrate this
the whole Gospel was written. That there is in
man the possibility of a more than merely earthly
life; that in him has been planted the germ of a
divine life; that this life, when divinely developed,
brings with it a new light and power; that
God is in the soul and the soul may live in perpetual
consciousness of its God; that Christ is
not merely a Memory and a Hope, but a Presence;
that the Supernatural is not a past phenomenon,
but a present and a perpetual experience;
that <span style="white-space:nowrap;">miracles—that</span> is, signs of the divine,
All-mighty <span style="white-space:nowrap;">love—are</span> forever going on in human
experience, on a transcendently grander scale in
the nineteenth century than they did in the first;
that the evidence of Christianity is not to be
sought in dingy and doubtful records of past
events, but in the personal observation and witness
of present occurrences; that revelation was
not completed with the Apocalypse, but every
devout soul has the promise of an inner light,
and the invisible and Catholic brotherhood and
household of faith, which is the true church of
Christ, has in it an everlasting Shechinah, which
reveals with perpetually increasing clearness the
truth of God both to it and through it; and that
fidelity to the sacred and sweet duties of love is
at once the condition and the result of this living
experience of an ever-living God, in the spiritual
realm as in nature, every fruit being the seed
vessel of new growths for the <span style="white-space:nowrap;">future:—this</span> I
believe to be the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ
according to John. And I believe there is no
better protection against that skepticism of the
present age, whose vice is not that it demands a
reason for every faith, but that it denies the witness
of the spiritual sight to spiritual things, than
the patient, meditative study of this Gospel, except
the patient, persistent pursuit of the life to
which it invites. To those that have no faith in
such a life and such a light, to whom Christ is only
a mist-covered mountain seen across the intervening
eighteen centuries, and God only an hypothesis
made probable by the Paleyrian argument from
design, this Commentary will probably give no
aid, and this Gospel will even appear to be uninterpretable
in its mysticism. To those that have
this faith in a perpetually present Immanuel, a
Christ who is ever a God with us, however dim the
faith may be, these pages are commended in the
prayer and hope that they may help to make
the Gospel clearer, the faith stronger, and the
Christ nearer and dearer.</p>

<h3>Transcriber’s Note:</h3>

<p>Words may have multiple spelling
variations or inconsistent hyphenation in the text. These have been
left unchanged, as were obsolete and alternative
spellings. Misspelled words were corrected.</p>

<p>Footnotes were renumbered sequentially; those in the Preface were moved to the
end of the chapter; footnotes in lines of scripture follow immediately thereafter. Obvious printing errors, such as
backwards, upside down, or partially printed letters and punctuation, were corrected.
Final stops missing at the end of sentences and abbreviations were
added.</p>

<p>The text was rearranged so that each line of scripture, its footnotes,
and its commentary are together as a unit. The index includes references to the author’s books on the
Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, as well as those included in this book.
In the index, “Commerce, in the temple” has no page reference.</p>

<p>The following items were changed:</p>

<ul><li><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> “John 3:11” to “John <a href="#chg2">3:21</a>”</li>
<li>“ought” to “<a href="#chg3"><i>aught</i></a>” to eat ...</li>
